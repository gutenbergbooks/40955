<span class="i2">O Lady, judge, if judge you may,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And gray&#8211;hair&#8217;d sires the tales would tell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When doors were barr&#8217;d, and eldron dame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That through the smoke and gloom alone<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>&#8220;It will be a bloody night in Gemsop
this,&#8221; said Walter of Chapelhope, as he sat
one evening by the side of his little parlour
fire, and wrung the rim of his wet bonnet
into the grate. His wife sat by his side,
airing a pair of clean hosen for her husband,
to replace his wet ones. She looked
stedfastly in his face, but uttered not a
word;&#8212;it was one of those looks that cannot
be described, but it bespoke the height
of curiosity, mingled with a kind of indefinite
terror. She loved and respected her
husband, and sometimes was wont to teaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
or cajole him from his purpose; but one
glance of his eye, or scowl of his eyebrow,
was a sufficient admonition to her when she
ventured to use such freedom.</p>

<p>The anxious stare that she bent on his
face at this time was enquiry enough, what
he meant by the short and mysterious sentence
he had just uttered; but from the fulness
of his heart he had said that which he
could not recal, and had no mind to commit
himself farther. His eldest son, John,
was in the room too, which he had not remarked
before he spoke, and therefore he
took the first opportunity to change the
subject. &#8220;Gudewife,&#8221; said he, tartly,
&#8220;what are ye sittin glowrin like a bendit
wulcat there for? Gae away and get me
something to eat; I&#8217;m like to fa&#8217; atwae wi&#8217;
sheer hunger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunger, father!&#8221; said the lad; &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I saw ye take as much meat to the hill
with you as might have served six.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter looked first over the one shoulder
at him, and then over the other, but, repressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his wrath, he sat silent about the
space of two minutes, as if he had not heard
what the youth said. &#8220;Callant,&#8221; then said
he, with the greatest seeming composure,
&#8220;rin away to the hill, an&#8217; see after the eild
nowt; ca&#8217; them up by the Quare Burn, an&#8217;
bide wi&#8217; them till they lie down, gin that
sudna be till twal o&#8217;clock at night&#8212;Gae
away when I bid ye&#8212;What are ye mumgin
at?&#8221; And saying so, he gave him such a
thwack on the neck and shoulders with the
wet bonnet as made him make the best of
his way to the door. Whether he drove
the young cattle as far as the Quare Burn,
or whether he looked after them that night
or not, Walter made no farther enquiry.</p>

<p>He sat still by his fire wrapt in deep
thought, which seemed to increase his uneasy
and fretful mood. Maron Linton, (for
that was the goodwife of Chapelhope&#8217;s
name) observing the bad humour of her
husband, and knowing for certain that
something disagreeable had befallen him,
wisely forbore all intermeddling or teazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
questions respecting the cause. Long experience
had taught her the danger of these.
She bustled about, and set him down the
best fare that the house afforded; then, taking
up her tobacco pipe, she meditated an
escape into the kitchen. She judged that
a good hearty meal by himself might somewhat
abate his chagrin; and, besides, the
ominous words were still ringing in her
ears&#8212;&#8220;It will be a bloody night in Gemsop
this&#8221;&#8212;and she longed to sound the shepherds
that were assembled around the kitchen
fire, in order to find out their import.
Walter, however, perceiving her drift, stopped
her short with&#8212;&#8220;Gudewife, whar are
ye gaun sae fast&#8212;Come back an&#8217; sit down
here, I want to speak t&#8217;ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maron trembled at the tone in which these
words were spoken, but nevertheless did as
she was desired, and sat down again by the
fire. &#8220;Weel, Watie, what is&#8217;t?&#8221; said she,
in a low and humble tone.</p>

<p>Walter plied his spoon for some time
without deigning any reply; then turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
full upon her, &#8220;Has Kate been in her bed
every night this week?&#8221; asked he seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear gudeman, whaten a question&#8217;s
that to speer at me&#8212;What can hae put sic
a norie i&#8217; your head as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no answerin my question, Maron,
but speerin ither twa instead o&#8217;t&#8212;I axt
ye gin Kate hadna been out o&#8217; her bed for
some nights bygane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sude I ken ony thing about that,
gudeman?&#8212;ye may gang an&#8217; speer at her&#8212;Out
o&#8217; her bed, quotha!&#8212;Na&#8212;there&#8217;ll
nae young skempy amang them wile her
out o&#8217; her bed i&#8217;the night&#8211;time.&#8212;Dear
gudeman, what has put it i&#8217;your head that
our bairn stravaigs i&#8217;the night&#8211;time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na, Maron, there&#8217;s nae mortal soul
will ever gar ye answer to the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear gudeman, wha heard ever tell o&#8217;
a <i>mortal</i> soul?&#8212;the soul&#8217;s no mortal at a&#8217;&#8212;Didna
ye hear our ain worthy curate&#8211;clerk
say&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;O, Maron! Maron! ye&#8217;ll aye be the
auld woman, if the warld sude turn upside&#8211;down!&#8212;Canna
ye answer my question
simply, ay or no, as far as ye ken, whether
our daughter has been out o&#8217; her bed at
midnight for some nights bygane or no?&#8212;If
ye ken that she has, canna ye tell me sae
at aince, without ganging about the bush?
it&#8217;s a thing that deeply concerns us baith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Troth, gudeman, gin she hae been out
o&#8217; her bed, mony a honest man&#8217;s bairn has
been out o&#8217; her bed at midnight afore her,
an&#8217; nae ill in her mind nouther&#8212;the thing&#8217;s
as common as the rising o&#8217; the se&#8217;en
sterns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter turned round towards his meal,
after casting a look of pity and despair
upon his yokefellow, who went on at
great length defending the equivocal practice
of young women who might deem
it meet and convenient to leave their
beds occasionally by night; for that, without
some mode of private wooing, it was
well known that no man in the country
could possibly procure a wife, for that
darkness rendered a promise serious, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
passed in open day for a mere joke, or
words of course; and at length Maron
Linton, with more sagacity than usual, concluded
her arguments with the following
home remark:&#8212;&#8220;Ye ken fu&#8217; weel, gudeman,
ye courtit me i&#8217;the howe o&#8217; the night
yoursel; an&#8217; Him that kens the heart kens
weel that I hae never had cause to rue our
bits o&#8217; trysts i&#8217;the dark&#8212;Na, na! mony&#8217;s
the time an&#8217; aft that I hae blest them, an&#8217;
thought o&#8217; them wi&#8217; pleasure! We had ae
kind o&#8217; happiness then, Watie, we hae another
now, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll hae another yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in this appeal that
it would have been unnatural to have resisted.
There is a tenderness in the recollection
of early scenes of mutual joy and
love, that invariably softens the asperity of
our nature, and draws the heart by an invisible
bond toward the sharer of these;
but when they are at one view connected
with the present and the future, the delight
receives a tinge of sublimity. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
short, the appeal was one of the most happy
that ever fell from the lips of a simple
and ignorant, though a well&#8211;meaning woman.
It was not lost upon Walter; who,
though of a rough exterior and impatient
humour, was a good man. He took his
wife&#8217;s hand and squeezed it, while the pupil
of his eye expanded like that of a huge
mountain ram, when he turns it away from
the last ray of the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;My gude auld wife,&#8221; said he, &#8220;God
bless ye!&#8212;Ye hae bits o&#8217; queer gates
whiles, but I wadna part wi&#8217; ye, or see ane
o&#8217; yer grey hairs wranged, for a&#8217; the ewes
on the Hermon Law.&#8221;&#8212;Maron gave two
or three sobs, and put the corner of her
check&#8211;apron upon the eye that was next
Walter.&#8212;&#8220;Fair fa&#8217; your heart, Maron,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;we&#8217;ll say nae mair about it; but,
my woman, we maun crack about our bits
o&#8217; hame affairs, an&#8217; I had the strongest
reasons for coming to the truth o&#8217; yon;
however, I&#8217;ll try ither means.&#8212;But, Maron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Linton, there&#8217;s anither thing, that in spite
o&#8217; my heart is like to breed me muckle
grief, an&#8217; trouble, an&#8217; shame.&#8212;Maron, has
the Brownie o&#8217; Bodsbeck been ony mair
seen about the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Troth, gudeman, ye&#8217;re aye sae hard i&#8217;
the belief&#8212;wi&#8217; a&#8217; your kindness to me and
mine, ye hae a dour, stiff, unbowsome kind
o&#8217; nature in ye&#8212;it&#8217;ll hardly souple whan
steepit i&#8217; yer ain e&#8217;esight&#8212;but I can tell ye
for news, ye&#8217;ll no hae a servant about yer
house, man, woman, nor boy, in less than
a fortnight, if this wicked and malevolent
spirit canna be put away&#8212;an&#8217; I may say i&#8217;
the language o&#8217; Scripture, &#8216;My name is
Legion, for we are many.&#8217; It&#8217;s no ae
Brownie, nor twa, nor half&#8211;a&#8211;score, that&#8217;s
about the house, but a great hantle&#8212;they
say they&#8217;re ha&#8217;f deils ha&#8217;f fock&#8212;a thing that
I dinna weel understand. But how many
bannocks think ye I hae baken in our
house these eight days, an&#8217; no a crust o&#8217;
them to the fore but that wee bit on your
trencher?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;I little wot, gudewife; maybe half&#8211;a&#8211;dizen
o&#8217; dizens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half&#8211;a&#8211;dizen o&#8217; dizens, gudeman!&#8212;aye
sax dizen o&#8217; dizens!&#8212;a&#8217; the meal girnels i&#8217;
the country wadna stand it, let abee the
wee bit meal ark o&#8217; Chapelhope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gudewife, I&#8217;m perfectly stoundit. I
dinna ken what to say, or what to think,
or what to do; an&#8217; the mair sae o&#8217; what I
have heard sin&#8217; I gaed to the hill&#8212;Auld
John o&#8217; the Muir, our herd, wha I ken
wadna tell a lee for the Laird o&#8217; Drumelzier&#8217;s
estate, saw an unco sight the night
afore last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy on us, gudeman! what mair has
been seen about the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell ye, gudewife&#8212;on Monanday
night he cam yont to stop the ewes aff the
hogg&#8211;fence, the wind being eissel&#8212;it was
a wee after midnight, an&#8217; the moon wasna
just gane down&#8212;he was sittin i&#8217; the scug
o&#8217; a bit cleuch&#8211;brae, when, or ever he wist,
his dog Keilder fell a gurrin&#8217; an&#8217; gurrin&#8217;, as
he had seen something that he was terrified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for&#8212;John took him aneath his plaid, an&#8217;
held him, thinkin it was some sheep&#8211;stealers;
but or it was lang he saw a white
thing an&#8217; a black thing comin&#8217; up the
Houm close thegither; they cam by within
three catloups o&#8217; him&#8212;he grippit his
cudgel firm, an&#8217; was aince gaun to gie
them strength o&#8217; arm, but his power failed
him, an&#8217; a&#8217; his sinnens grew like dockans;
there was a kind o&#8217; glamour cam o&#8217;er his
een too, for a&#8217; the hope an&#8217; the heaven grew
as derk as tar an&#8217; pitch&#8212;but the settin
moon shone even in their faces, and he saw
them as weel as it had been fore&#8211;day. The
tane was a wee bit hurklin crile of an unearthly
thing, as shrinkit an&#8217; wan as he had
lien seven years i&#8217; the grave; the tither
was like a young woman&#8212;an&#8217; what d&#8217;ye
think? he says he&#8217;ll gang to death wi&#8217;t
that it was outher our dochter or her
wraith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maron lifted up her eyes and her clasped
hands toward the ceiling, and broke out
with the utmost vehemence into the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
raving ejaculation:&#8212;&#8220;O mercy,
mercy! Watie Laidlaw!&#8212;O, may Him
that dwalls atween the Sherubeams be wi&#8217;
us, and preserve us and guide us, for we are
undone creatures!&#8212;O, Watie Laidlaw,
Watie Laidlaw! there&#8217;s the wheel within
the wheel, the mystery o&#8217; Babylon, the mother
of harlots, and abominations of the
earth&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maron Linton!&#8212;What are ye sayin?&#8212;Haud
yer tongue, Maron Linton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O gudeman, I thought it was the young
fallows ye jaloosed her wi&#8217;&#8212;I wish it had.
I wad rather hae seen her i&#8217;the black stool,
in the place where repentance is to be
hoped for; but now she&#8217;s i&#8217;the deil&#8217;s ain
hands. I jaloosed it, Watie&#8212;I kend it&#8212;I
was sure o&#8217;t lang syne&#8212;our bairn&#8217;s changed&#8212;she&#8217;s
transplanted&#8212;she&#8217;s no Keaty Laidlaw
now, but an unearthly creature&#8212;we
might weel hae kend that flesh an&#8217; blude
cude never be sae bonny&#8212;Goodman, I hae
an awsome tale to tell ye&#8212;Wha think ye
was it that killed Clavers&#8217; Highlanders?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;That, I suppose, will remain a mystery
till the day when a&#8217; secrets will be cleared
up, an&#8217; a&#8217; the deeds o&#8217; darkness brought to
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sae may it be, Watie! Sae may it be!
But it was neither ane nor other but our ain
only dochter Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re ravin, Maron&#8212;troth, ye&#8217;re gaun
daft&#8212;a bit sklendry lassie o&#8217; aughteen kill
sae mony armed Highlanders?&#8212;Hout fye!
keep within bounds, Maron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard her wi&#8217; thir lugs it&#8217;s i&#8217;my head&#8212;Stannin
on that very room floor, I heard
her gie the orders to her Brownie. She was
greetin whan I cam in&#8212;I listened and heard
her saying, while her heart was like to loup,
&#8216;Wae&#8217;s me! O wae&#8217;s me! or mid&#8211;day
their blood will be rinning like water!&#8212;The
auld an&#8217; the young, the bonny an&#8217; the
gude, the sick an&#8217; the woundit&#8212;That blude
may cry to Heaven, but the cauld earth
will drink it up; days may be better, but
waur they canna be! Down wi&#8217; the clans,
Brownie, and spare nae ane.&#8217; In less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ten minutes after that, the men were found
dead. Now, Watie, this is a plain an&#8217; positive
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter&#8217;s blood curdled within him at
this relation. He was superstitious, but he
always affected to disbelieve the existence
of the Brownie, though the evidences were
so strong as not to admit of any doubt; but
this double assurance, that his only daughter,
whom he loved above all the world besides,
was leagued with evil spirits, utterly
confounded him. He charged his wife, in
the most solemn manner, never more, during
her life, to mention the mysterious circumstance
relating to the death of the
Highland soldiers. It is not easy to conceive
a pair in more consummate astonishment
than Walter and his spouse were by
the time the conversation had reached this
point. The one knew not what to think, to
reject, or believe&#8212;the other believed all,
without comprehending a single iota of
that she did believe; her mind endeavoured
to grasp a dreadful imaginary form, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the dimensions were too ample for its reasoning
powers; they were soon dilated,
burst, and were blown about, as it were, in
a world of vision and terror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Before proceeding with the incidents as
they occurred, which is the common way
of telling a story in the country, it will be
necessary to explain some circumstances
alluded to in the foregoing chapter.</p>

<p>Walter Laidlaw rented the extensive
bounds of Chapelhope from the Laird of
Drummelzier. He was a substantial, and
even a wealthy man, as times went then,
for he had a stock of 3000 sheep, cattle,
and horses; and had, besides, saved considerable
sums of money, which he had
lent out to neighbouring farmers who
were not in circumstances so independent
as himself.</p>

<p>He had one only daughter, his darling,
who was adorned with every accomplishment
which the country could then afford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and with every grace and beauty that a
country maiden may possess. He had
likewise two sons, who were younger than
she, and a number of shepherds and female
servants.</p>

<p>The time on which the incidents here
recorded took place, was, I believe, in the
autumn of the year 1685, the most dismal
and troublous time that these districts of
the south and west of Scotland ever saw,
or have since seen. The persecution for
religion then raged in its wildest and most
unbridled fury: the Covenanters, or the
whigs, as they were then called, were proscribed,
imprisoned, and at last hunted
down like wild beasts. Graham, Viscount
of Dundee, better known by the detested
name of Clavers, set loose his savage troopers
upon those peaceful districts, with peremptory
orders to plunder, waste, disperse,
and destroy the conventiclers, wherever
they might be found.</p>

<p>All the outer parts of the lands of Chapelhope
are broken into thousands of deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
black ruts, called by the country people
<i>moss haggs</i>. Each of the largest of these
has a green stripe along its bottom; and
in this place in particular they are so numerous,
so intersected and complex in
their lines, that, as a hiding&#8211;place, they
are unequalled&#8212;men, foxes, and sheep,
may all there find cover with equal safety
from being discovered, and may hide for
days and nights without being aware of
one another. The neighbouring farms to
the westward abound with inaccessible
rocks, caverns, and ravines. To these
mountains, therefore, the shattered remains
of the fugitives from the field of
Bothwell Bridge, as well as the broken
and persecuted whigs from all the western
and southern counties, fled as to their last
refuge. Being unacquainted, however,
with the inhabitants of the country in
which they had taken shelter&#8212;with their
religious principles, or the opinions which
they held respecting the measures of government&#8212;they
durst not trust them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the secret of their retreat. They had
watches set, sounds for signals, and skulked
away from one hiding&#8211;place to another
at the approach of the armed troop, the
careless fowler, or the solitary shepherd;
yea, such precautions were they obliged to
use, that they often fled from the face of
one another.</p>

<p>From the midst of that inhospitable
wilderness&#8212;from those dark mosses and
unfrequented caverns&#8212;the prayers of the
persecuted race nightly arose to the throne
of the Almighty&#8212;prayers, as all testified
who heard them, fraught with the most
simple pathos, as well as the most bold
and vehement sublimity. In the solemn
gloom of the evening, after the last rays
of day had disappeared, and again in the
morning before they began to streamer the
east, the song of praise was sung to that
Being, under whose fatherly chastisement
they were patiently suffering. These
psalms, always chaunted with ardour and
wild melody, and borne on the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
breezes of the twilight, were often heard
at a great distance. The heart of the peasant
grew chill, and his hairs stood all on
end, as he hasted home to alarm the cottage
circle with a tale of horror. Lights
were seen moving by night in wilds and
caverns where human thing never resided,
and where the foot of man seldom had
trode.</p>

<p>The shepherds knew, or thought they
knew, that no human being frequented
these places; and they believed, as well
they might, that whole hordes of spirits
had taken possession of their remote and
solitary dells. They lived in terror and
consternation. Those who had no tie in
the country left it, and retreated into
the vales, where the habitations of men
are numerous, and where the fairy, the
brownie, or the walking ghost, is rarely
seen. Such as had friends whom they
could not leave, or sheep and cattle upon
the lands, as the farmers and shepherds
had, were obliged to remain, but their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
astonishment and awe continued to increase.
They knew there was but one
Being to whom they could apply for protection
against these unearthly visitants;
family worship was begun both at evening
and morning in the farmers&#8217; hall and the
most remote hamlet; and that age introduced
a spirit of devotion into those regions,
which one hundred and thirty years
continuance of the utmost laxity and indecision
in religious principles has not yet
been able wholly to eradicate.</p>

<p>It is likewise necessary to mention here,
though perfectly well known, that every
corner of that distracted country was furnished
with a gownsman, to instruct the
inhabitants in the <i>mild</i> and <i>benignant</i> principles
of prelacy, but chiefly to act as spies
upon the detested whigs. In the fulfilment
of this last task they were not remiss; they
proved the most inveterate and incorrigible
enemies that the poor covenanters had,
even though heaven, earth, and hell seemed
to have combined against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>The officiating priest at the kirk of Saint
Mary of the Lowes had been particularly
active in this part of his commission. The
smallest number could not be convened for
the purposes of public devotion&#8212;two or
three stragglers could not be seen crossing
the country, but information was instantly
sent to Clavers, or some one of his officers;
and, at the same time, these devotional
meetings were always described to be of
the most atrocious and rebellious nature.
The whigs became grievously incensed
against this ecclesiastic, for, in the bleakest
mountain of their native land, they
could not enjoy a lair in common with the
foxes and the wild&#8211;goats in peace, nor worship
their God without annoyance in the
dens and caves of the earth. Their conventicles,
though held in places ever so remote,
were broke in upon and dispersed
by armed troops, and their ministers and
brethren carried away to prisons, to banishment,
and to death. They waxed desperate;
and what will not desperate men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
do? They way&#8211;laid, and seized upon one
of the priest&#8217;s emissaries by night, a young
female, who was running on a message to
Grierson of Lag. Overcome with fear at
being in custody of such frightful&#8211;looking
fellows, with their sallow cheeks and long
beards, she confessed the whole, and gave
up her dispatches. They were of the most
aggravated nature. Forthwith two or three
of the most hardy of the whigs, without
the concurrence or knowledge of their
brethren, posted straight to the Virgin&#8217;s
chapel that very night, shot the chaplain,
and buried him at a small distance from
his own little solitary mansion; at the
same time giving out to the country, that
he was a sorcerer, an adulterer, and a character
every way evil. His name has accordingly
been handed down to posterity
as a most horrid necromancer.</p>

<p>This was a rash and unpremeditated act;
and, as might well have been foreseen, the
cure proved worse than the disease. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
brought the armed troops upon them both
from the east and the west. Dundee came
to Traquair, and stationed companies of
troops in a line across the country. The
Laird of Lag placed a body of men in the
narrowest pass of Moffatdale, in the only
path by which these mountains are accessible.
Thus all communication was cut off
between the mountain&#8211;men and the western
counties; for every one who went or
came by that way, these soldiers took prisoner,
searched, and examined; and one
lad, who was coming from Moffat, carrying
more bread than they thought he could
well account for, they shot dead on the
spot just as he had dropt on his knees to
pray.</p>

<p>A curate, named Clerk, still remained,
to keep an eye upon the whigs and pester
them. He had the charge of two chapels
in that vicinity; the one at a place now
called Kirkhope, which was dedicated to
Saint Irene, a saint of whom the narrator
of this story could give no account. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
other was dedicated to Saint Lawrence;
the remains of it are still to be seen at
Chapelhope, in a small circular inclosure
on the west side of the burn. Clerk was
as malevolent to the full against the proscribed
party as his late brother, but he
wanted the abilities of the deceased; he
was ignorant, superstitious, and had assumed
a part of the fanaticism in religion
of the adverse party, for it was the age
and the country of fanaticism, and nothing
else would take. By that principally he
had gained some influence among his hearers,
on whom he tried every stimulant to
influence them against the whigs. The
goodwife of Chapelhope was particularly
attached to him and his tenets; he held
her completely in leading&#8211;strings; her concience
approved of every thing, or disapproved,
merely as he directed; he flattered
her for her deep knowledge in true and
sound divinity and the Holy Scriptures, although
of both she was grossly ignorant.
But she had learned from her preceptor a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
kind of cant&#8212;a jargon of religious terms
and sentences of Scripture mixed, of which
she had great pride but little understanding.
She was just such a character as would
have been a whig, had she ever had an opportunity
of hearing or conversing with any
of that sect. Nothing earthly could be so
truly ludicrous as some of her exhibitions
in a religious style. The family and servants
were in general swayed by their mistress,
who took a decided part with Clerk
in all his schemes against the whigs, and
constantly dispatched one of her own servants
to carry his messages of information
to the king&#8217;s officers. This circumstance
soon became known to the mountain&#8211;men,
and though they were always obliged to
take refuge on the lands of Chapelhope by
day, they avoided carefully all communication
with the family or shepherds (for several
of the shepherds on that farm lived in
cottages at a great distance from one another
and from the farm&#8211;house.)</p>

<p>Walter despised Clerk and his tenets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
most heartily; he saw that he was a shallow,
hypocritical, and selfish being, and that
he knew nothing of the principles in which
he pretended to instruct them; therefore
he sorely regretted the influence that he
had gained over his family. Neither did he
approve of the rigid and rebellious principles
which he believed the Covenanters professed.
When he met with any man, or
community of men, who believed firmly in
any thing and held it sacred, Walter revered
that, and held it sacred likewise; but
it was rather from a deference to the belief
and feelings of his fellow creatures than
his own conviction. In short, Walter was
an honest, conscientious, good, old&#8211;fashioned
man, but he made no great fuss about
religion, and many supposed that he did
not care a pin who was right or who was
wrong.</p>

<p>On the 23d of August, Clavers (I think
it best to denominate him so, as he is always
called by that name in the country,)
dispatched nineteen men from Traquair, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the command of one Copland, a gentleman
volunteer in his troop, and a very
brave young man, to gain intelligence concerning
the murder of the curate, and use
every means to bring the perpetrators to
justice. Copland and his men came to the
mansion of the late chaplain, where they
remained all the night, and made every enquiry
that they could concerning the murderers.
Several witnesses were brought in
and examined, and among others the very
identical girl whom the whigs took prisoner,
and robbed of the dispatches. She had
heard the letter read by one of the gang
who seized her, while the rest stood and
listened. It bore, &#8220;that great numbers of
the broken and rebellious traitors kenneled
in the wilds around Loch&#8211;Skene, from
whence they committed depredations on
all the countries about; that they likewise
made religious incursions into those districts,
where great multitudes attended their
inflammatory harangues.&#8221; It also stated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;that a noted incendiary was to preach on
such a day in Kirkinhope Linn, where the
whole group might easily be surrounded
and annihilated; that many of them were
armed with guns, bludgeons, and broadswords,
but that they were the most cowardly,
heartless dogs alive; and that he
himself, who had private and certain information
of all their hiding places, would
engage to rid the country of them in a few
days, if Lag would allow him but one company
of soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Copland now began to suspect that his
force was too small to accomplish any
thing of moment; he determined, however,
to make a dash into the wild next
morning, and, if possible, to seize some
prisoners, and thereby gain more accurate
information. On the morning of the 24th,
having procured two trusty guides, he proceeded
on his expedition. He and nine of
his followers went up by a place called
Sheilhope, the other nine by Chapelhope&#8212;they
were to scour the broken ground, take
all those prisoners whom they found skulking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fire upon such as refused to stand, and meet
on a certain height at noon. Copland and his
party reached the appointed place without
making any reprisal; they perceived some
stragglers on the heights and rocks at a
great distance, who always vanished away,
like beings not of this world. Three of
the other party took one poor lad prisoner,
who was so spent and emaciated that he
had been unable to fly at the signal&#8211;sound;
but so intent were they on blood that he
was not ever brought before their leader,
who never so much as knew of the capture.</p>

<p>The guide was wont to relate the circumstances
of this poor man&#8217;s trial and
execution, for, but for him, no such thing
would ever have been known; the death
of a whig, or a straggler of any kind, was
then a matter of no concern&#8212;They were
three Brae&#8211;mar Highlanders who took him;
like the most part of his associates, he
answered their questions in a surly manner,
and by the most cutting retorts, which
particularly enraged a Donald Farquharson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
one of the party, against him. &#8220;Weel,
I&#8217;ll pe pitting you to &#8217;e test, and tat fery
shun, my coot freen,&#8221; said Donald; &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll just pe teeling you, eince for a&#8217;, tat ye
haif ne meer but tway meenets and a half
to leef.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor forlorn wight answered, &#8220;that
he expected no better at their hands,&#8212;that
he desired no longer time, and
he hoped they would bear patiently with
him for that short space.&#8221; He then
kneeled down and prayed most fervently,
while Donald, who wanted only a hair to
make a tether of, as the saying is, seemed
watching diligently for a word at which to
quarrel. At length he spoke words to the
following purport. &#8220;Father, forgive these
poor misled creatures, as I forgive them;
they are running blindly upon a wrong
path, and without the power of thy grace
they shall never gain the right one more.&#8221;
Donald, who did not well understand the
dialect in which the prisoner prayed, looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shrewdly at his companions. &#8220;Dugald
More,&#8221; said he&#8212;&#8220;Dugald More, fat&#8217;s &#8217;e
man saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is praying,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;that
we may lose our way, and never find it
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n &#8217;e soul o&#8217; &#8217;e tief, is he?&#8221; said
Donald, and ran him through with his bayonet.</p>

<p>The wounded man groaned, and cried
most piteously, and even called out &#8220;murder,&#8221;
but there was none to rescue or regard
him. The soldiers, however, cut the
matter short, by tossing him into a deep
hole in the morass, where he sunk in the
mire and was seen no more.</p>

<p>When Copland arrived at the place of
rendezvous, five out of his ten associates
were no where to be seen, nor did they
make their appearance, although he tarried
there till two in the afternoon. The guide
then conducted him by the path on which
those missing should have come, and on
arriving at a narrow pass in Chapelhope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he found the bodies of the four soldiers
and their guide mangled and defaced in no
ordinary way; and judging from this that
he had been long enough in that neighbourhood,
he hasted back to Traquair with
the news of the loss. Clavers is said to
have broke out into the most violent rage,
and to have sworn that night by the Blessed
Virgin and all the Holy Trinity, utterly
to extirpate the seed of the d&#8209;&#8209;d whining
psalm&#8211;singing race from the face of the
earth, and that ere Beltein there should not
be as much whig blood in Scotland as
would make a dish of soup to a dog. He
however concealed from the privy council
the loss of these five men, nor did they
ever know of it to this day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Things were precisely in this state, when
the goodman of Chapelhope, taking his
plaid and staff, went out to the heights one
misty day in autumn to drive off a neighbour&#8217;s
flock from his pasture; but, as Walter
was wont to relate the story himself,
when any stranger came there on a winter
evening, as long as he lived, it may haply
be acceptable to the curious, and the lovers
of rustic simplicity, to read it in his own
words, although he drew it out to an inordinate
length, and perhaps kept his own
personal feelings and prowess too much in
view for the fastidious or critical reader to
approve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was on a mirk misty day in September,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
said Walter, &#8220;I mind it weel, that I
took my plaid about me, and a bit gay
steeve aik stick in my hand, and away I
sets to turn aff the Winterhopeburn sheep.
The wind had been east&#8211;about a&#8217; that harst,
I hae some sma&#8217; reason ne&#8217;er to forget it,
and they had amaist gane wi&#8217; a&#8217; the gairs
i&#8217; our North Grain. I weel expected I wad
find them a&#8217; in the scaithe that dark day,
and I was just amind to tak them hame in
a drove to Aidie Andison&#8217;s door, and say,
&#8216;Here&#8217;s yer sheep for ye, lad; ye maun
outher keep them better, or else, gude
faith, I&#8217;ll keep them for ye.&#8217;&#8212;I had been
crost and put about wi&#8217; them a&#8217; that year,
and I was just gaun to bring the screw to
the neb o&#8217; the mire&#8211;snipe.&#8212;Weel, off I
sets&#8212;I had a special dog at my feet, and
a bit gay fine stick in my hand, and I was
rather cross&#8211;natured that day&#8212;&#8216;Auld Wat&#8217;s
no gaun to be o&#8217;er&#8211;trampit wi&#8217; nane o&#8217; them,
for a&#8217; that&#8217;s come and gane yet,&#8217; quo&#8217; I to
mysel as I gaed up the burn.&#8212;Weel, I
slings aye on wi&#8217; a gay lang step; but, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the time that I had won the Forkings, I gat
collied amang the mist, sae derk, that fient
a spark I could see&#8212;Stogs aye on through
cleuch and gill, and a&#8217; the gairs that they
used to spounge, but, to my great mervel,
I can nouther see a hair of a ewe&#8217;s tail, nor
can I hear the bleat of a lamb, or the bell
of a wether&#8212;No ane, outher of my ain or
ither folks!&#8212;&#8216;Ay,&#8217; says I to mysel, &#8216;what
can be the meaning o&#8217; this? od, there has
been somebody here afore me the day!&#8217;
I was just standin looking about me amang
the lang hags that lead out frae the head
o&#8217; the North Grain, and considering what
could be wort of a&#8217; the sheep, when I noticed
my dog, Reaver, gaun coursing away
forrit as he had been setting a fox. What&#8217;s
this, thinks I&#8212;On he gangs very angry
like, cocking his tail, and setting up his
birses, till he wan to the very brink of a
deep hag; but when he gat there, my certy,
he wasna lang in turning! Back he
comes, by me, an&#8217; away as the deil had
been chasing him; as terrified a beast I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
saw never&#8212;Od, sir, I fand the very hairs
o&#8217; my head begin to creep, and a prinkling
through a&#8217; my veins and skin like needles
and preens.&#8212;&#8216;God guide us!&#8217; thinks I,
&#8216;what can this <i>be</i>?&#8217; The day was derk,
derk; for I was in the very stamoch o&#8217; the
cludd, as it were; still it was the day time,
an&#8217; the e&#8217;e o&#8217; Heaven was open. I was as
near turned an&#8217; run after my tike as ever
I&#8217;ll miss, but I just fand a stound o&#8217; manheid
gang through my heart, an&#8217; forrit I
sets wi&#8217; a&#8217; the vents o&#8217; my head open. &#8216;If
it&#8217;s flesh an&#8217; blude,&#8217; thinks I, &#8216;or it get the
owrance o&#8217; auld Wat Laidlaw, od it sal get
strength o&#8217; arm for aince.&#8217; It was a deep
hag, as deep as the wa&#8217;s o&#8217; this house, and
a strip o&#8217; green sward alang the bottom
o&#8217;t; and when I came to the brow, what
does I see but twa lang liesh chaps lying
sleeping at ither&#8217;s sides, baith happit wi&#8217;
the same maud. &#8216;Hallo!&#8217; cries I, wi&#8217; a
stern voice, &#8216;wha hae we here?&#8217; If ye
had but seen how they lookit when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
stertit up; od, ye wad hae thought they
were twa scoundrels wakened frae the
dead! I never saw twa mair hemp&#8211;looking
dogs in my life.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are ye feared for, lads? Whaten
twa blades are ye? Or what are ye seeking
in sic a place as this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is a derk day, gudeman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is a derk day, gudeman! That&#8217;s
sic an answer as I heard never. I wish ye
wad tell me something I dinna ken&#8212;and
that&#8217;s wha ye are, and what ye&#8217;re seeking
here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re seeking nought o&#8217; yours, friend.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I dinna believe a word o&#8217;t&#8212;ye&#8217;re nae
folk o&#8217; this country&#8212;I doubt ye ken o&#8217;er
weel what stealing o&#8217; sheep is&#8212;But if ye
winna tell me plainly and honestly your
business here, the deil be my inmate gin I
winna knock your twa heads thegither.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is a gude auld say, honest man,
<i>It is best to let sleeping dogs lie, they may
rise and bite you</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8216;Bite <i>me</i>, lad!&#8212;Rise an&#8217; bite <i>me</i>!&#8212;I
wad like to see a dog on a&#8217; the heights o&#8217;
Chapelhope that wad snarl at me, let be to
bite!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a gay steeve dour aik stick in
my hand, an&#8217; wi&#8217; that I begoud to heave&#8217;t
up, no to strike them, but just to gi&#8217;e
them a glisk o&#8217; the coming&#8211;on that was
in&#8217;t. By this time they were baith on their
feet; and the ane that was neist me he
gi&#8217;es the tabie of his jockey&#8211;coat a fling
back, and out he pu&#8217;s a braid sword frae
aneath it&#8212;an&#8217; wi&#8217; the same blink the ither
whups a sma&#8217; spear out o&#8217; the heart o&#8217; his
aik stick, &#8216;Here&#8217;s for ye then, auld camstary,&#8217;
says they; &#8216;an unlucky fish gets an
unlucky bait.&#8217; Od sir, I was rather stoundit;
I began to look o&#8217;er my shouther, but
there was naething there but the swathes
o&#8217; mist. What wad I hae gien for twa minutes
of auld John o&#8217; the Muchrah! However,
there was nae time to lose&#8212;it was
come fairly to the neb o&#8217; the mire&#8211;snipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wi&#8217; me. I never was gude when taken by
surprise a&#8217; my life&#8212;gie me a wee time, an&#8217;
I turn quite foundemental then&#8212;sae, to
tell the truth, in my hurry I took the flier&#8217;s
part, flang the plaid frae me, and ran off
up the hag as fast as my feet could carry
me, an&#8217; a&#8217; the gate the ragamuffian wi&#8217; the
sword was amaist close at my heels. The
bottom o&#8217; the hag was very narrow, twa
could hardly rin abreast. My very bluid
began to rise at being chased by twa skebels,
and I thought I heard a voice within
me, crying, &#8216;Dinna flee, Wat Laidlaw!
dinna flee, auld Wat! ye hae a gude cause
by the end!&#8217; I wheeled just round in a moment,
sir, and drew a desperate straik at
the foremost, an&#8217; sae little kend the haniel
about fencing, that instead o&#8217; sweeing aff
my downcome wi&#8217; his sword, he held up
his sword&#8211;arm to save his head&#8212;I gart his
arm just snap like a pipe&#8211;stapple, and down
fell his bit whittle to the ground, and he
on aboon it. The tither, wi&#8217; his sma&#8217; spear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
durstna come on, but ran for it; I followed,
and was mettler o&#8217; foot than he, but I
durstna grip him, for fear he had run his
bit spit through my sma&#8211;fairns i&#8217; the struggle,
for it was as sharp as a lance, but I
keepit a little back till I gat the end o&#8217; my
stick just i&#8217; the how o&#8217; his neck, and then
I gae him a push that soon gart him plew
the flow with his nose. On aboon him I
gets, and the first thing I did was to fling
away his bit twig of a sword&#8212;I gart it
shine through the air like a fiery dragon&#8212;then
I took him by the cuff o&#8217; the neck,
and lugged him back to his neighbour, wha
was lying graning in the hag. &#8216;Now, billies,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;ye shall answer face to face, it wad
hae been as good soon as syne; tell me directly
wha ye are, and what&#8217;s your business
here, or, d&#8217;ye hear me, I&#8217;ll tye ye thegither
like twa tikes, and tak ye to them that will
gar ye speak.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! lack&#8211;a&#8211;day, lack&#8211;a&#8211;day!&#8217; said the
wounded man, &#8216;ye&#8217;re a rash, foolish, passionate
man, whaever ye be.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8216;Ye&#8217;re maybe no very far wrang there,&#8217;
quo&#8217; I; &#8216;but for aince, I trow, I had gude
reason. Ye thought to kill <i>me</i> wi&#8217; your
bits o&#8217; shabbles o&#8217; swords!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In the first place then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;ken
that we wadna hae shed ae drap o&#8217; your
blood, nor wranged a hair o&#8217; your head&#8212;all
that we wanted was to get quit of ye, to
keep ye out o&#8217; danger an&#8217; scaith. Ye hae
made a bonny day&#8217;s wark on&#8217;t truly, we had
naething in view but your ain safety&#8212;but
sin&#8217; ye will ken ye maun ken; we belang
to a poor proscribed remnant, that hae fled
from the face of a bloody persecution. We
have left all, and lost all, for the cause of our
religion, and are driven into this dismal
wilderness, the only miserable retreat left
us in our native land.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Od, sir! he hadna weel begun to speak
till the light o&#8217; the truth began to dawn within
me like the brek o&#8217; the day&#8211;sky, an&#8217; I grew
as red too, for the devil needna hae envied
me my feelings at that time. I couldna
help saying to mysel, &#8216;Whow, whow, Wat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Laidlaw! but ye hae made a bonny job o&#8217;t
this morning!&#8212;Here&#8217;s twa puir creatures,
worn out wi&#8217; famine and watching, come
to seek a last refuge amang your hags and
mosses, and ye maun fa&#8217; to and be pelting
and threshing on them like an incarnate
devil as ye are.&#8212;Oh, wae&#8217;s me! wae&#8217;s me!&#8217;&#8212;Lord,
sir, I thought my heart wad burst&#8212;There
was a kind o&#8217; yuke came into my
een that I could hardly bruke; but at
length the muckle tears wan out wi&#8217; a sair
faught, and down they came down ower
my beard, dribble for dribble. The men
saw the pliskie that I was in, and there was
a kind o&#8217; ruefu&#8217; benevolence i&#8217; their looks,
I never saw ony thing like it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dinna be wae for us, honest man,&#8217;
said they; &#8216;we hae learned to suffer&#8212;we
hae kend nought else for this mony a lang
and bloody year, an&#8217; we look for nought
else for the wee while we hae to sojourn in
this weary world&#8212;we hae learned to suffer
patiently, and to welcome our sufferings as
mercies.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8216;Ye&#8217;ve won a gude length, man,&#8217; quo&#8217;
I; &#8216;but they&#8217;re mercies that I&#8217;m never very
fond o&#8217;&#8212;I wish ye had suffered under ony
hand but mine, sin&#8217; it be your lot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dinna be sorry for us, honest man;
there never was an act o&#8217; mair justice than
this that ye hae inflicted. Last night there
were fifteen o&#8217; us met at evening worship&#8212;we
hadna tasted meat for days and nights;
to preserve our miserable lives, we stole a
sheep, dressed, and ate it; and wi&#8217; this
very arm that you hae disabled, did I grip
and kill that sheep. It was a great sin,
nae doubt, but the necessity was also great&#8212;I
am sae far punished, and I hope the
Lord will forgie the rest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If he dinna,&#8217; quo&#8217; I, &#8216;he&#8217;s no what I
think him.&#8217; Then he began a lang serious
harangue about the riches o&#8217; free grace,
and about the wickedness o&#8217; our nature;
and said, that we could do naething o&#8217; oursells
<i>but</i> sin. I said it was a hard construction,
but I couldna argy the point ava
wi&#8217; him&#8212;I never was a dab at these lang&#8211;winded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
stories. Then they cam on about
prelacy and heresies, and something they
ca&#8217;d the act of abjuration. I couldna follow
him out at nae rate; but I says, I
pit nae doubt, callants, but ye&#8217;re right, for
ye hae proven to a&#8217; the warld that ye think
sae; and when a man feels conscious that
he&#8217;s right, I never believe he can be far
wrang in sic matters. But that&#8217;s no the
point in question; let us consider what
can be done for ye e&#8217;en now&#8212;Poor souls!
God kens, my heart&#8217;s sair for ye; but this
land&#8217;s mine, an&#8217; a&#8217; the sheep around ye, an&#8217;
ye&#8217;re welcome to half&#8211;a&#8211;dozen o&#8217; the best o&#8217;
them in sic a case.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! lack&#8211;a&#8211;day, lack&#8211;a&#8211;day! If ye be
the gudeman o&#8217; the Chapelhope, ye&#8217;ll rue
the day that ever ye saw us. If it&#8217;s kend
that ye countenanced us in word or deed,
ye&#8217;re a ruined man; for the blood&#8211;hounds
are near at hand, and they&#8217;ll herry ye out
and in, but and ben&#8212;Lack&#8211;a&#8211;day! lack&#8211;a&#8211;day!
in a wee while we may gang and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
come by the Chapelhope, and nouther see a
lum reek nor hear a cock craw; for Clavers
is on the one hand and Lag on the
other, and they&#8217;re coming nearer and nearer
us every day, and hemming us in sairer and
sairer&#8212;renounce us and deny us, as ye wish
to thrive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Na, na, lads, let them come&#8212;let them
come their ways! Gin they should take a&#8217;
the ewes and kye on the Chapelhope, I can
stock it o&#8217;er again. I dinna gie a bawbee
about your leagues, and covenants, and associations,
for I think aye there&#8217;s a good
deal o&#8217; faction and dourness in them; but
or I&#8217;ll desert a fellow&#8211;creature that&#8217;s oppressed,
if he&#8217;s an honest man, and lippens
to me, od, I&#8217;ll gie them the last drap o&#8217; my
heart&#8217;s bluid.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they heard that, they took me
out to the tap of a knowe, and began to
whistle like plovers&#8212;nae herd alive could
hae kend but they were plovers&#8212;and or
ever I wist, ilka hag, and den, and tod&#8211;hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
round about, seemed to be fu&#8217; o&#8217; plovers,
for they fell a&#8217; to the whistling an&#8217; answering
ane another at the same time. I had
often been wondering how they staid sae
lang on the heights that year, for I heard
them aye whewing e&#8217;en an&#8217; morn; but little
trowed I they were a&#8217; twa&#8211;handed plovers
that I heard. In half an hour they
had sic a squad gathered thegither as e&#8217;e
never glimed on. There ye might hae seen
auld gray&#8211;bearded ministers, lairds, weavers,
and poor hinds, a&#8217; sharing the same
hard fate. They were pale, ragged, and
hungry, and several o&#8217; them lame and
wounded; and they had athegither sic a
haggard severity i&#8217; their demeaner. Lord
forgie me, gin I wasna feared to look at
them! There was ane o&#8217; them a doctor
blade, wha soon set the poor chield&#8217;s arm;
and he said, that after a&#8217; it wasna broken,
but only dislockit and sair brizzed. That
doctor was the gabbiest body ever I met
wi&#8217;; he spake for them a&#8217;, and I whiles feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that he sclented a wee. He tried a&#8217; that
he could to make me a Cameronian, but I
wadna grip; and when I was coming away
to leave him, &#8216;Laidlaw,&#8217; quo&#8217; he, &#8216;we ken
ye to be an honest, honourable man; here
you see a remnant of poor, forlorn, misrepresented
creatures, who have thrown themselves
on your mercy; if ye betray us, it
will be the worse for ye both here and hereafter;
if you save and protect us, the prayers
of the just win their way to Heaven,
though fiends should be standing by to oppose
them&#8212;Ay, there&#8217;s naething can stop
<i>their</i> journey, Laidlaw!&#8212;The winds canna
blaw them aside, the clouds canna drown
them, and the lights o&#8217; Heaven canna burn
them; and your name will stand at that bar
where there&#8217;s nae cruel and partial judge&#8212;What
you gie to us, ye gie to your Maker,
and he will repay you seven fold.&#8217; Od, the
body was like to gar me play the bairn and
greet even out. Weel, I canna mind the
half that he said, but he endit wi&#8217; this:&#8212;&#8216;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have seen our friends all bound, banished,
and destroyed; they have died on
the field, on the scaffold, and at the stake;
but the reek o&#8217; their blood shall drive the
cruel Stuarts frae the land they have disgraced,
and out of it a church of truth and
liberty shall spring. There is still a handfu&#8217;
remaining in Israel that have not yet bowed
the knee to Baal, nor yet kissed him&#8212;That
remnant has fled here to escape the
cruelty of man; but a worse fate threatens
us now&#8212;we are all of us perishing with famine&#8212;For
these three days we have tasted
nothing but the green moss, save a few
wretched trouts, eels, and adders.&#8217; &#8216;Ethers,
man!&#8217; quo&#8217; I,&#8212;&#8216;For the love o&#8217; God take
care how ye eat the ethers&#8212;ye may as weel
cut your throats at aince as eat them. Na,
na, lad, that&#8217;s meat that will never do.&#8217; I
said nae mair, but gae just a wave to my
dog. &#8216;Reaver,&#8217; quo&#8217; I, &#8216;yon&#8217;s away.&#8217;&#8212;In
three minutes he had ten score o&#8217; ewes
and wedders at my hand. I grippit twa o&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the best I could wale, and cut aff their heads
wi&#8217; my ain knife. &#8216;Now, doctor,&#8217; quo&#8217; I,
&#8216;take these and roast them, and part them
amang ye the best way ye can&#8212;ye&#8217;ll find
them better than the ethers&#8212;Lord, man,
it will never do to eat ethers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After a hearty laugh, in which his guests
generally joined, Walter concluded thus:
&#8220;That meeting cost me twa or three hunder
round bannocks, and mae gude ewes
and wedders than I&#8217;ll say; but I never
missed them, and I never rued what I did.
Folk may say as they like, but I think aye
the prayers out amang the hags and rash&#8211;bushes
that year did me nae ill&#8212;It is as
good to hae a man&#8217;s blessing as his curse,
let him be what he may.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter never went farther with his story
straight onward than this; for it began to
involve family concerns, which he did not
much like to recount. He had a number
of abstract stories about the Covenanters
and their persecutors; but as I must now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
proceed with the narrative as I gathered it
from others, these will be interwoven in
their due course.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>Walter visited them next day at the
time and place appointed, taking with him
a dozen of bannocks and a small cheese.
These he was obliged to steal out of his
own pantry, for he durst not by any means
trust his wife and family with the discovery
he had made, knowing that he might as
well have confided it with the curate himself,
the sworn enemy of his motley protegees.
They gathered around him with protestations
of gratitude and esteem; for the
deserted and oppressed generally cling to
the first symptoms of friendship and protection
with an ardency that too often overshoots
its aim. Walter naturally felt an honest
pride, not so much in that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
done, as that he intended to do; but before
he produced his repast, he began in a
most serious way to question them relating
to some late incidents already mentioned.</p>

<p>They all with one assent declared, and
took God to witness, that they knew nothing
at all about the death of the five soldiers;
that it was not perpetrated by them,
nor any connected with them; nor could
they comprehend, in the least degree, how
it was effected, if not by some supernatural
agency&#8212;a judgment sent down from Heaven
for their bloody intent. With regard
to the murder of the priest, they were sorry
that they knew so much. It was perpetrated
by a few rash men of their number,
but entirely without their concurrent assent,
as well as knowledge; that though
his death might have been necessary to the
saving of a great number of valuable lives,
they had, nevertheless, unanimously protested
against it; that the perpetrators had
retired from their body, they knew not
whither; and that at that very time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Rev. Messrs Alexander Shiels and James
Renwick were engaged in arranging for
publication a general protest against many
things alleged against them by their enemies,
and that among others.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>There was a candour in this to which
Walter&#8217;s heart assented. He feasted them
with his plentiful and homely cheer&#8212;promised
to visit them every day, and so to
employ his shepherds that none of them
should come into that quarter to distress
them. Walter was as good as his word&#8212;He
visited them every day&#8212;told them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the news that he could gather of the troops
that beleagured them&#8212;of the executions
that were weekly and daily taking place&#8212;and
of every thing else relating to the state
of the country. He came loaden with food
to them daily; and when he found it impossible
to steal his own bread, butter,
and cheese, he supplied their wants from
his flock. The numbers of the persecuted
increased on his hands incalculably&#8212;The
gudewife of Chapelhope&#8217;s bannocks vanished
by scores, and the unconscionable, insatiable
Brownie of Bodsbeck was blamed
for the whole.</p>

<p>Some time previous to this, a young vagrant,
of the name of Kennedy, chanced to
be out on these moors shooting grouse,
which were extremely plentiful. He tarried
until the twilight, for he had the art of
calling the heath&#8211;fowl around him in great
numbers, by imitating the cry of the hen.
He took his station for this purpose in one
of those moss&#8211;hags formerly described; but
he had not well begun to call ere his ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
were saluted by the whistling of so many
plovers that he could not hear his own
voice. He was obliged to desist, and lay
for some time listening, in expectation that
they would soon cease crying. When lying
thus, he heard distinctly the sound of something
like human voices, that spoke in
whispers hard by him; he likewise imagined
that he heard the pattering of feet,
which he took for those of horses, and, convinced
that it was a raid of the fairies, he
became mortally afraid; he crept closer to
the earth, and in a short time heard a swell
of the most mellifluous music that ever rose
on the night. He then got up, and fled
with precipitation away, as he thought, from
the place whence the music seemed to
arise; but ere he had proceeded above an
hundred paces, he met with one of the
strangest accidents that ever happened to
man.</p>

<p>That same night, about, or a little before,
the hour of midnight, two of Laidlaw&#8217;s men,
who happened to be awake, imagined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
they heard a slight noise without; they
arose, and looked cautiously out at a small
hole that was in the end of the stable where
they slept, and beheld to their dismay the
appearance of four men, who came toward
them carrying a coffin; on their coming
close to the corner of the stable, where the
two men stood, the latter heard one of
them say distinctly, in a whisper, &#8220;Where
shall we lay him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must leave him in the barn,&#8221; said
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said a third, &#8220;the door of that
will be locked;&#8221; and they past on.</p>

<p>The men were petrified; they put on
their clothes, but they durst not move, until,
in a short time thereafter, a dreadful
bellowing and noise burst forth about the
door of the farm&#8211;house. The family was
alarmed, and gathered out to see what was
the matter; and behold! there lay poor
Kennedy in a most piteous plight, and, in
fact, stark staring mad. He continued in
a high fever all the night, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
morning; but a little after noon he became
somewhat more calm, and related to them
a most marvellous tale indeed.</p>

<p>He said, that by the time he arose to
fly from the sound of the music, the moor
was become extremely dark, and he could
not see with any degree of accuracy where
he was running, but that he still continued
to hear the sounds, which, as he thought,
came still nigher and nigher behind him.
He was, however, mistaken in this conjecture;
for in a short space he stumbled on
a hole in the heath, into which he sunk at
once, and fell into a pit which he described
as being at least fifty fathom deep; that he
there found himself immediately beside a
multitude of hideous beings, with green
clothes, and blue faces, who sat in a circle
round a small golden lamp, gaping and
singing with the most eldrich yells. In
one instant all became dark, and he felt a
weight upon his breast that seemed heavier
than a mountain. They then lifted him up,
and bore him away through the air for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hundreds of miles, amid regions of utter
darkness; but on his repeating the name of
Jesus three times, they brought him back,
and laid him down in an insensible state at
the door of Chapelhope.</p>

<p>The feelings depicted in the features of
the auditors were widely different on the
close of this wonderful relation. The
beauteous Katharine appeared full of anxious
and woful concern, but no marks of
fear appeared in her lovely face. The servants
trembled every limb, and declared
with one voice, that no man about Chapelhope
was now sure of his life for a moment,
and that nothing less than double wages
should induce them to remain there another
day. The goodwife lifted up her eyes to
Heaven, and cried, &#8220;O the vails! the
vails!&#8212;the vails are poured, and to pour!&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter pretended to laugh at the whole
narration; but when he did, it was with an
altered countenance, for he observed, what
none of them did, that Kennedy had indeed
been borne through the air by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
means or other; for his shoes were all covered
with moss, which, if he had walked,
could not have been there, for the grass
would have washed it off from whatever
quarter he had come.</p>

<p>Kennedy remained several days about
Chapelhope in a thoughtful, half delirious
frame; but no entreaties could prevail with
him at that time to accompany the men of
the place to where he supposed the accident
had happened, nor yet to give them
any account where it was situated, for he
averred that he heard a voice say to him
in a solemn tone, &#8220;If you wish to live
long, never tell what you have seen to&#8211;night,
nor ever come this way again.&#8221;
Happy had it been for him had he attended
all along to this injunction. He
slipped away from Chapelhope in a few
days, and was no more seen until the time
that Copland and his men appeared there.
It was he who came as guide to that soldiers
that were slain, and he fell with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the strait linn of the South Grain of
Chapelhope.</p>

<p>These mysterious and unaccountable
incidents by degrees impressed the minds
of the inhabitants with terror that cannot
be described; no woman or boy would
go out of doors after sunset, on any
account whatever, and there was scarcely
a man who durst venture forth alone
after the fall of evening. If they could
have been sure that brownies and fairies
had only power to assume the human
shape, they would not have been nearly
in such peril and perplexity; but there
was no form of any thing animate or inanimate,
save that of a lamb, that they
were sure of; they were of course waylaid
at every turn, and kept in continual agitation.
An owl was a most dangerous and
suspicious&#8211;looking fellow&#8212;a white glede
made them quake, and keep a sharp look&#8211;out
upon his course in the air&#8212;a hare,
with her large intelligent eyes and equivocal
way of walking, was an object of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
distrust&#8212;and a cat, squalling after dark,
was the devil. Many were the ludicrous
scenes that occurred, among which I cannot
help mentioning those which follow, as
being particularly whimsical.</p>

<p>Jasper, son to old John of the Muchrah,
was the swiftest runner of his time; but of
all those whose minds were kept in continual
agitation on account of the late inundation
of spirits into the country, Jasper
was the chief. He was beset by them
morning and evening; and even at high
noon, if the day was dark, he never considered
himself as quite safe. He depended
entirely upon his speed in running to avoid
their hellish intercourse; he essayed no
other means&#8212;and many wonderful escapes
he effected by this species of exertion alone.
He was wont to knit stockings while tending
his flock on the mountains; and happening
to drop some yarn one evening, it
trailed after him in a long ravelled coil
along the sward. It was a little after the
sun had gone down that Jasper was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whistling and singing over the shoulder of
the Hermon Law, when, chancing to cast
a casual glance behind him, he espied
something in shape of a horrible serpent,
with an unequal body, and an enormous
length of tail, coming stealing along the
bent after him. His heart leapt to his
mouth, (as he expressed it,) and his hair
bristled so that it thrust the bonnet from
his head. He knew that no such monster
inhabited these mountains, and it momently
occurred to him that it was the Brownie
of Bodsbeck come to seize him in that most
questionable shape. He betook him to his
old means of safety in great haste, never
doubting that he was well qualified to run
from any object that crawled on the ground
with its belly; but, after running a considerable
way, he perceived his adversary
coming at full stretch along the hill after
him. His speed was redoubled; and, as
he noted now and then that his inveterate
pursuer gained no ground on him, his exertion
was beyond that of man. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
two shepherds on an opposite hill who saw
Jasper running without the plaid and the
bonnet, and with a swiftness which they
described as quite inconceivable. The
cause set conjecture at defiance; but they
remarked, that though he grew more and
more spent, whenever he glanced behind
he exerted himself anew, and strained a
little harder. He continued his perseverance
to the last, as any man would do who
was running for bare life, until he came to
a brook called the Ker Cleuch, in the crossing
of which he fell down exhausted; he
turned on his back to essay a last defence,
and, to his joyful astonishment, perceived
that the serpent likewise lay still and did
not move. The truth was then discovered;
but many suspected that Jasper never overcame
that heat and that fright as long as
he lived.</p>

<p>Jasper, among many encounters with the
fairies and brownies, had another that terminated
in a manner not quite so pleasant.
The Brownie of Bodsbeck, or the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the Fairies, (he was not sure which of
them it was,) came to him one night as he
was lying alone, and wide awake, as he
conceived, and proffered him many fine
things, and wealth and honours in abundance,
if he would go along to a very fine
country, which Jasper conjectured must
have been Fairyland. He resisted all these
tempting offers in the most decided manner,
until at length the countenance of his
visitant changed from the most placid and
bewitching beauty to that of a fiend. The
horrible form grappled with him, laid hold
of both his wrists, and began to drag him
off by force; but he struggled with all the
energy of a man in despair, and at length,
by a violent exertion, he disengaged his
right hand. The enemy still continuing,
however, to haul him off with the other, he
was obliged to have recourse to a desperate
expedient. Although quite naked, he reached
his clothes with the one hand and drew
his knife; but, in endeavouring to cut off
those fingers which held his wrist so immovably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
fast, he fairly severed a piece of the
thumb from his own left hand.</p>

<p>This was the very way that Jasper told
the story to his dying day, denying stoutly
that he was in a dream; and, singular as it
may appear, I can vouch for the truth of it.
Jasper Hay died at Gattonside at a right
old age, in the year 1739; and they are
yet alive who have heard him tell those
stories, and seen him without the thumb
of the left hand.</p>

<p>Things went on in this distracted and
doubtful manner until the time when Walter
is first introduced. On that day, at the
meeting place, he found no fewer than 130
of the poor wanderers, many of them assembled
to see him for the last time, and
take an affectionate leave of him; for they
had previously resolved to part, and scatter
themselves again over the west country,
even though certain death awaited them,
as they could not in conscience longer remain
to be the utter ruin of one who was
so generous and friendly to them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
saw, that not only would his whole stock
be wasted, but he would himself be subjected
to confiscation of goods, and imprisonment,
if to nothing worse. Walter said,
the case seemed hard either way; but he
had been thinking, that perhaps, if they
remained quiet and inoffensive in that seclusion,
the violence of the government
might in a little relax, and they might then
retire to their respective homes in peace.
Walter soon heard with vexation that they
made conscience of <i>not living in peace</i>, but
of proclaiming aloud to the world the grievous
wrongs and oppression that the church
of Christ in Scotland laboured under. The
<i>doctor chap</i>, as Walter always called him,
illustrated at great length the sin that
would lie to their charge, should they remain
quiet and passive in a time like that,
when the church&#8217;s all was at stake in these
realms. &#8220;We are but a remnant,&#8221; added
he, &#8220;a poor despised remnant; but if none
stand up for the truth of the reformed religion,
how are ever our liberties, civil or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ecclesiastical, to be obtained? There are
many who think with us, and who feel
with us, who yet have not the courage to
stand up for the truth; but the time must
ere long come, that the kingdoms of the
land will join in supporting a reformation,
for the iniquity of the Amorite is wearing
to the full.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter did not much like disputing about
these matters; but in this he felt that his
reason acquiesced, and he answered thus:
&#8220;Ye speak like a true man, and a clever
man, Doctor; and if I had a desperate
cause by the end, and wanted ane to back
me in&#8217;t, the deil a step wad I gang ayont
this moss hag to find him; but, Doctor,
there&#8217;s a time for every thing. I wadna
hae ye to fling away a gude cause, as I
wad do a rotten ewe, that winna haud ony
langer. But dinna ye think that a fitter
time may come to mak a push? ye&#8217;ll
maybe sell mae precious lives for nae end,
wi&#8217; your declarations; take care that you,
and the like o&#8217; you, haena these lives to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
answer for.&#8212;I like nae desperate broostles&#8212;od,
man, it&#8217;s like ane that&#8217;s just gaun to
turn divour, taking on a&#8217; the debt he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinna fear, gudeman! dinna fear!
There&#8217;s nae blood shed in sic a cause that
can ever be shed in vain. Na, na! that
blood will argue better at the bar o&#8217; Heaven
for poor distressed Scotland than all
the prayers of all the living. We hae done
muckle, but we&#8217;ll do mair yet&#8212;muckle
blood has been wantonly and diabolically
shed, and our&#8217;s may rin wi&#8217; the rest&#8212;we&#8217;ll
no thraw&#8217;t wantonly and exultingly away;
but, when our day comes, we&#8217;ll gie it cheerfully&#8212;as
cheerfully, gudeman, as ever ye
paid your mail to a kind landlord, even
though the season had been hard and stormy.
We had aince enough of this warld&#8217;s
wealth, and to spare; but we hae naething
now but our blood, and we&#8217;ll part wi&#8217;
that as cheerfully as the rest. And it will
tell some day! and ye may live to see it
yet. But enough, gudeman; we have all
resolved, that, whatever the consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
may be, to live no more on your bounty&#8212;therefore,
do not urge it&#8212;but give us all
your hand&#8212;Farewell!&#8212;and may God bless
you in all your actings and undertakings!&#8212;There
is little chance that we shall ever
meet again&#8212;We have no reward to give
but our blessing and good wishes; but,
whenever a knee here present is bowed at
the footstool of grace, you will be remembered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter could not bear thus to part with
them, and to give them up as it were to
certain destruction. He argued as well as
he could on the imprudence of the step
they were going to take&#8212;of the impossibility
of their finding a retreat so inaccessible
in all the bounds of the south of Scotland,
and the prospect that there was of
the persecution soon relaxing. But when
he had said all that he could say, a thin
spare old man, with grey dishevelled locks,
and looks, Walter said, as stern as the adders
that he had lately been eating, rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
up to address him. There was that in his
manner which commanded the most intense
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost thou talk of our rulers relaxing?&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Blind and mistaken man!
thou dost not know them. No; they will
never relax till their blood shall be mixed
with their sacrifices. That insatiate,
gloomy, papistical tyrant and usurper, the
Duke of York, and his commissioner, have
issued laws and regulations more exterminating
than ever. But yesterday we received
the woeful intelligence, that, within
these eight days, one hundred and fifty of
our brethren have suffered by death or banishment,
and nearly one&#8211;half of these have
been murdered, even without the sham formality
of trial or impeachment, nor had
they intimation of the fate that awaited
them. York hath said in full assembly,
&#8216;that neither the realm nor the mother&#8211;church
can ever be safe, until the south of
Scotland is again made a hunting forest;&#8217;
and his commissioner hath sworn by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
living God, &#8216;that never a whig shall again
have time or warning to prepare for Heaven,
for that hell is too good for them.&#8217;
Can we hope for these men relaxing? No!
The detestable and bloody Clavers, that
wizard! that eater of toads! that locust of
the infernal pit, hems us in closer and closer
on one side, and that Muscovite beast on
the other! They thirst for our blood; and
our death and tortures are to them matter
of great sport and amusement. My name
is Mackail! I had two brave and beautiful
sons, and I had but two; one of these had
his brains shot out on the moss of Monyhive
without a question, charge, or reply. I gathered
up his brains and shattered skull with
these hands, tied them in my own napkin,
and buried him alone, for no one durst assist
me. His murderers stood by and mocked
me, cursed me for a dog, and swore if I
howled any more that they would send me
after him. My eldest son, my beloved
Hew, was hung like a dog at the Market&#8211;cross
of Edinburgh. I conversed with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I prayed with him in prison, kissed him,
and bade him farewell on the scaffold!
My brave, my generous, my beautiful son!
I tell thee, man, thou who preachest up
peace and forbearance with tyrants, should
ever the profligate Charles, or his diabolical
brother&#8212;should ever the murderer
Clavers, or any of his hell&#8211;hounds of the
north, dare set foot in Heaven, one look
from the calm benignant face of my martyred
son would drive them out howling!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time the old man shed not a
tear; his voice was wildly solemn, but his
looks were mixed with madness. He had
up his hand to swear, to pray, or to prophecy,
Walter knew not which, but he was
restrained by his associates, and led aside,
so that Walter saw no more of him; but he
said he could not get him out of his mind
for many a day, for sic another desperate
auld body he had never seen.</p>

<p>These harangues took up much of the
time that they had to spare, but ere they
parted Walter persuaded them, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by his strong homely reasoning, to remain
where they were. He said, since they
persisted in refusing to take more of his
flock, there was an extensive common beyond
the height, called Gemsope, which
had been a royal forest, where many gentlemen
and wealthy farmers had sheep that
fed promiscuously; and considering their
necessitous circumstances, he thought it no
evil, and he advised them to go and take
from that glen as many as would serve to
support nature for a time;&#8212;that for his part
he had many a good wedder and dinmont
there, and was willing to run his risk, which
would then fall equal on a number, and
only on such as were rich and could well
bear it. In this plan, after some scruples
which were overborne by the majority,
they at length fully and thankfully acquiesced.</p>

<p>That same day, on his way homeward,
Walter heard the wonderful relation of the
apparition of his beloved daughter in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Hope at midnight; he learned that Clavers
would be there in a few days, and he had
sent away above 100 men to steal sheep&#8212;all
these things made him thoughtful and
uneasy after he had reached his home, wet
and fatigued.&#8212;&#8220;It will be a bloody night
in Gemsope this,&#8221; he said, sighing, not recollecting
what he said or to whom he said
it. He could trust his wife with any of his
family concerns, but as long as she continued
to be so much influenced by the curate
Clerk, the sworn enemy of his poor
persecuted flock, he durst not give her a
hint of their retreat.</p>

<p>Walter became still more and more perplexed
from all that he heard from his wife,
as well as from every one else&#8212;he found
that, in truth, there was some mysterious
thing about his house&#8212;the whole family
seemed convinced of it&#8212;there were many
things seen, heard, and done there that he
could in nowise account for in a rational
way, and though he resisted the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
belief for a good while, that the house was
haunted, circumstances at length obliged
him to yield to the torrent, and he believed
as faithfully in the Brownie of Bodsbeck
as any of them all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>The house which Walter occupied was
on the very spot where the farm&#8211;house of
Chapelhope now stands, but it was twice
as long; indeed, a part of the house that
is still standing, or was lately so, is the very
one that was built for Laidlaw when he
first entered to that large farm. There
was likewise an outshot from the back of
the house, called the Old Room, which had
a door that entered from without, as well
as one from the parlour within. The end
of this apartment stood close to the bottom
of the steep bank behind the house, which
was then thickly wooded, as was the whole
of the long bank behind, so that, consequently,
any one, with a little caution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
might easily have gone out or come in
there, without being seen by any of the family.
It contained a bed, in which any
casual vagrant, or itinerant pedlar slept, besides
a great deal of lumber; and as few
entered there, it had altogether a damp,
mouldy, dismal appearance. There was
likewise a dark closet in one corner of it,
with an old rusty lock, which none of the
family had ever seen opened.</p>

<p>The most part of the family soon grew
suspicious of this place. Sounds, either
real or imaginary, were heard issuing from
it, and it was carefully shunned by them
all. Walter had always, as I said, mocked
at the idea of the Old Room being haunted,
until that very night when we began with
him, and where, after many round&#8211;abouts,
we have now found him again.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that the conversation
between Walter and his wife, which is
narrated in the first chapter of this book,
terminated with a charge from him never
more to mention the mysterious story relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to their daughter and these five men
that were destroyed. After this she retired
about some housewife business, and
left Walter by himself to muse on that he
had seen and heard. He was sitting musing,
and that deeply, on the strange apparition
of his daughter that old John had
seen, when he thought he heard something
behind him making a sound as if it growled
inwardly. He looked around and saw
that it was his dog Reaver, who was always
an inmate of every place that his master
entered&#8212;he was standing in an attitude of
rage, but at the same time there was a mixture
of wild terror in his appearance&#8212;His
eyes, that gleamed like red burning coals,
were pointed directly to the door that opened
from the corner of the parlour into the
Old Room&#8212;Walter was astonished, for he
well knew his acuteness, but he kept his
eyes on him and said not a word&#8212;The dog
went forward with a movement scarce perceptible,
until he came close to the door,
but on putting his nose and ear to the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of it, he burst out with such a bay and
howl as were truly frightful, and ran about
the apartment as if mad, trying to break
through the walls and window boards.&#8212;Walter
was fairly overcome; there is nothing
frightens a shepherd so much as the
seeing of his dog frightened. The shepherd&#8217;s
dog of the true breed will boldly attack
any animal on earth in defence of his
master, or at his command; and it is no
good sign indeed when he appears terrified,
for the shepherd well knows that his dog
can discover spirits by the savour of the
wind, when he is all unconscious that any
such beings are near.</p>

<p>Walter fled into the kitchen with precipitation&#8212;he
found all the family standing
in alarm, for they had heard the hideous
uproar in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said half&#8211;a&#8211;dozen
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter!&#8221; said Walter, churlishly&#8212;&#8220;nothing
at all is the matter&#8212;tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
me who of you were in the Old Room, and
what you were seeking there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;none of them had been in the
Old Room&#8212;the whole of the family were
present, nor had one of them been away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter&#8217;s countenance changed&#8212;he fixed
his eyes on the ground for the space of
a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am sure,&#8221; said he, emphatically,
&#8220;something worse is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>A breathless silence ensued; save that
some groans and muttered prayers issued
from the lips of the goodwife, who sat in a
posture of deep humility, with her brow
leaned on both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of you go and see,&#8221; added Walter,
&#8220;what it <i>is</i> that is in the Old Room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every eye in the house turned on another,
but no one spoke or offered to move.
At length Katharine, who seemed in great
anxiety lest any of them should have had
the courage to go, went lightly up to her
father, and said, &#8220;I will go, sir, if you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;Do, my dear, and let some of the men
go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; none of the men shall go with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, Keatie, make haste; light a
candle, and I will go with you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;with your leave, father, if I go,
I go alone; no one shall go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, my love, may not I, your
father, accompany you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, should you go with me into
the Old Room just now, perhaps you might
never be yourself again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the goodwife uttered a smothered
scream, and muttered some inarticulate
ejaculations, appearing so much affected,
that her daughter, dreading she would fall
into a fit, flew to support her; but on this
she grew ten times worse, screaming aloud,
&#8220;Avoid thee, Satan! avoid thee, Satan!
avoid thee, imp of darkness and despair!
avoid thee! avoid thee!&#8221; And she laid
about her violently with both hands. The
servants, taking it for granted that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bewitched, or possessed, fled aloof; but
Walter, who knew better how matters stood
with her mind than they, ran across the
floor to her in such haste and agitation,
that they supposed he was going to give
her <i>strength of arm</i>, (his great expedient
when hardly controuled,) but in place of
that, he lifted her gently in his arms, and
carried her to her bed, in the further end
of the house.</p>

<p>He then tried to sooth her by every
means in his power; but she continued in
violent agitation, sighing, weeping, and
praying alternately, until she wrought herself
into a high nervous fever. Walter,
growing alarmed for her reason, which
seemed verging to a dangerous precipice,
kept close by her bed&#8211;side. A little before
midnight she grew calm; and he, thinking
she had fallen asleep, left her for a short
time. Unfortunately, her daughter, drawn
toward her by filial regard and affection,
softly then entered the room. Maron Linton
was not so sound asleep as was supposed; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
instantly beheld the approach of that now
dreaded sorceress, and sitting up in her
bed, she screamed as loud as she was able.
Katharine, moved by a natural impulse,
hasted forward to the couch to calm her
parent; but the frenzied matron sprung
from her bed, threw up the window, and
endeavoured to escape; Katharine flew after
her, and seized her by the waist. When
Maron found that she was fairly in her
grasp at such an hour, and no help at hand,
she deemed all over with her, both body
and soul; which certainly was a case extreme
enough. She hung by the sash of
the window, struggled, and yelled out,
&#8220;Murder! murder! murder!&#8212;O Lord!
O Lord!&#8212;save! save! save! save!&#8212;Murder!
murder!&#8221; &amp;c. At length Walter rushed
in and seized her, ordering his weeping
daughter instantly to bed.</p>

<p>Maron thanked Heaven for this wonderful
and timely deliverance, and persuaded
now that Providence had a special and peculiar
charge over her, she became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
calm than she had been since the first
alarm; but it was a dreadful certainty that
she now possessed, that unearthly beings
inhabited the mansion along with her, and
that her daughter was one of the number,
or in conjunction with them. She spent
the night in prayer, and so fervent was she
in her devotions, that she seemed at length
to rest in the hope of their final accomplishment.
She did not fail, however, to hint
to Walter that something decisive ought to
be done to their daughter. She did not
actually say that she should be burnt alive
at a stake, but she spake of the trial by fire&#8212;or
that it might be better to throw her
into the lake, to make the experiment whether
she would drown or not; for she well
expected, in her own mind, that when
the creature found itself in such circumstances,
it would fly off with an eldrich
laugh and some unintelligible saying to its
own clime; but she was at length persuaded
by her husband to intrust the whole
matter to her reverend monitor, both as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the driving away the herd of Brownies, and
the exorcism of her daughter.</p>

<p>Never was man in such a predicament
as Walter now found himself with regard to
his family. Katharine had never been a
favourite with her mother, who doated on
her boys to the detriment of the girl, but to
him she was all in all. Her demeanour of
late completely puzzled him&#8212;The words
that she had said to him the preceding
evening had no appearance of jocularity;
besides, seriousness and truth formed her
natural character, and she had of late become
more reserved and thoughtful than
she had ever been before.</p>

<p>The bed that she slept in faced into the
parlour before mentioned; that which Walter
and his spouse occupied entered from
another apartment&#8212;their backs, however,
were only separated by a thin wooden partition.
Walter kept awake all that night,
thoughtful, and listening to every sound.
Every thing remained quiet till about the
second crowing of the cock; he then heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
something that scratched like a rat, but
more regularly, and in more distinct time.
After the noise had been repeated three
times at considerable intervals, he thought
he heard his daughter rising from her bed
with extraordinary softness and caution&#8212;He
laid his ear to a seam, and distinctly
heard the sound of words uttered in a
whisper, but of their import he could make
nothing. He then heard his daughter return
to her bed with the same caution that
she left it, utter some sighs, and fall sound
asleep.</p>

<p>After serious deliberation, Walter thought
his best expedient was to remove his daughter
from home for some time; and next
morning he proposed to her to go and spend
a week or two with her maternal uncle,
Thomas Linton, farmer at Gilmanscleuch.
To this she objected on several pretences;
but at length, when urged to it, positively
refused to leave her father&#8217;s house at that
time. He never in his life could say a harsh
word to her, but that day he appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
chagrined, and bade her, with some asperity,
keep away from her mother&#8217;s presence,
as her malady, which was a nervous complaint,
required the utmost quietness. This
she promised with her accustomed cheerfulness,
and they parted. During the day
she was absent for several hours, none
knowing whither she went, or by what way
she returned.</p>

<p>On the same day, the servants, who had
spent a sleepless night, packed up bag and
baggage, and went off in a body, all save
one elderly woman, who had lately come to
the house, and was a stranger to them all.
Her name, she said, was Agnes Alexander,
but she was better known by the familiar
one of Nanny Elshinder; her former history
and connections were doubtful, but she was
of a cheerful complaisant temper, and always
performed what she was ordered to do
without any remarks. Walter had hired her
at Moffat, in the fair called <i>The Third Friday</i>;
and told Maron when he came home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that &#8220;he had hired a wastlin auldish quean,
wha, he believed, was a wee crackit i&#8217;the
head, but, poor thing, she wasna like to
get a place, and was sic a good soul he
coudna think to leave her destitute; and
whanever he begoud to parley wi&#8217; her, od,
she brought him to the neb o&#8217; the mire&#8211;snipe
directly.&#8221; Saving this good woman,
all the house servants, man, woman, and
boy, deserted their service, and neither
promises nor threats could induce them to
stay another night about the town. They
said, &#8220;they might as weel bide i&#8217; hell; they
wad gang afore Gibby Moray, the king&#8217;s
shirra, whanever he likit about it; or, gin
he buid rather hae brawer burlymen, they
wad meet him face to face in the Parliment
Close.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter was now obliged to bring Jasper,
his young shepherd, down from the Muchrah,
to assist him in the labour of the farm&#8212;the
most unfit man in the world for a
haunted house. He knew that the Old Room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was frequented by his old adversary, the
Brownie of Bodsbeck. He likewise knew
that his young mistress was a witch, or
something worse, for the late servants had
told him, so that he had now a dangerous
part to act. Nevertheless, he came determined
to take the bull by the horns; for
as he and his father had stocks of sheep
upon the farm, they could not leave their
master, and he was never wont to disobey
him. He had one sole dependance&#8212;his
swiftness of foot&#8212;that had never yet failed
him in eschewing them, save in the solitary
instance of the serpent.</p>

<p>On the first day of his noviceship as a
labourer, he and his master were putting
some ropes on the dwelling&#8211;house to keep
on the thatch. Jasper wanting something
whereon to stand, for that purpose, and
being within a few yards of the door of
the Old Room, and knowing that the tubs
stood there, thoughtlessly dashed into it
to bring out one to stand on; but he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
not taken two steps within the door till he
beheld a human face, and nothing but a
face and a head, looking deliberately at
him. One would have thought that such a
man, seeing such a sight, would have cried
out, fled to his master on the other side of
the house, or into the kitchen to old Nanny.
Jasper did none of them all. He turned
round with such velocity that he fell&#8212;hasted
out at the door on all fours, and took to
the Piper&#8211;hill like a wild deer, praying fervently
all the way. His master saw him
from the ladder where he stood, and called
aloud after him, but he deigned not to heed
or look behind him&#8212;the head without the
body, and that at an ordinary distance from
the ground, was alone impressed on his
mind, and refused a share to any other consideration.
He came not back to the Chapelhope
that night.</p>

<p>Katharine, the young and comely friend
of the Brownie, having discovered that Jasper
had been introduced to her familiar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and knowing his truth and simplicity of
heart, earnestly desired to sound him on
the subject. She knew he would return to
assist her father and brothers with the farm
labour, in their present strait, by a certain
hour next morning, and she waited on him
by the way. He came accordingly; but
he knew her and her connections better
than she imagined. He tried to avoid her,
first by going down into the meadow, then
by climbing the hill; but seeing that she
waylaid him both ways, and suspecting her
intentions to be of the very worst nature,
he betook him to his old expedient&#8212;fled
with precipitation, and returned to the
Muchrah.</p>

<p>Katharine could by no means comprehend
this, and was particularly concerned
about it at this time, as she had something
she wished to reveal to him. Walter appeared
gloomy and discontented all that day.
The corn was ripe, but not a sheaf of it cut
down;&#8212;the hay was still standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
meadow, the lint was to pull, the potatoes
to raise, the tar to bring home, and the
sheep to smear; and there was no one left
to do all this but he and his two boys. The
gudewife, who used to bustle about and do
much household work, was confined to her
room. His daughter&#8217;s character, her demeanour,
and even her humanity, were become
somewhat doubtful. Walter was truly
in what he termed <i>a pickled priminary</i>.</p>

<p>Katharine, being still debarred all access
to her mother, began to dread that she
would be obliged to leave her father&#8217;s house;
and, in case of a last extremity, she bethought
her of sounding the dispositions of
old Nanny. She was a character not easily
to be comprehended. She spoke much to
herself, but little to any other person&#8212;worked
so hard that she seldom looked up,
and all the while sung scraps of old songs
and ballads, the import of which it was
impossible to understand; but she often
chaunted these with a pathos that seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to flow from the heart, and that never failed
to affect the hearer. She wore a russet
worsted gown, clouted shoes, and a quoif,
or mutch, upon her head, that was crimped
and plaited so close around her face that
very little of the latter was visible. In this
guise was Nanny, toiling hard and singing
her mournful ditty, when Katharine came
in and placed herself on a seat by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanny, this seems to be more than ordinary
a busy day with you; pray, what is
all this baking and boiling for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear bairn, dear bairn, what do I ken&#8212;the

<p>&#8220;Prithee go on, Nanny; let me hear
what it was that reddened the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear bairn, wha kens; some auld thing
an&#8217; out o&#8217; date; but yet it is sae like the
days that we hae seen, ane wad think the
poeter that made it had the second sight.
Mony a water as weel as the Clyde has
run reid wi&#8217; blude, an&#8217; that no sae lang sin&#8217;
syne!&#8212;ay, an&#8217; the wild burnies too! I hae
seen them mysel leave a reid strip on the

craw durstna pick there!&#8212;Dear bairn, has
the Chapelhope burn itsel never had the
hue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Katharine&#8217;s glance and Nanny&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
met each other, but were as quickly withdrawn,
for they dreaded one another&#8217;s converse;
but they were soon relieved from that
dilemma by Nanny&#8217;s melancholy chime&#8212;</p>

as I had last night!&#8212;I saw him aince
again&#8212;Yes, I saw him bodily, or may I

sobbed hard, and drew her arms across her
eyes.&#8212;&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; continued she,
&#8220;gie me a bit sang, dear bairn, an&#8217; let it
be an auld thing&#8212;they do ane&#8217;s heart gude
thae bits o&#8217; auld sangs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather tell me, Nanny&#8212;for we live
in ignorance in this wild place&#8212;what you
think of all that blude that has been shed
in our country since the killing&#8211;time began?
Do you think it has been lawfully
and rightfully shed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha doubts it, dear bairn?&#8212;Wha
doubts that?&#8212;But it will soon be ower now&#8212;the

<p>Katharine sat silent and thoughtful, eyeing
old Nanny with fixed attention; but the
muscles of her contracted face and wild unstable
eye were unintelligible. She therefore,
with a desponding mien, went out,
and left the crazy dame to discourse and
sing to herself. Nanny ceased her baking,
stood upright, and listened to the maid&#8217;s
departing steps, till judging her out of
hearing; she then sung out, in what is now
termed the true <i>bravura</i> style,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In the mean time, Katharine, on hearing
the loud notes of the song, had returned
within the door to listen, and heard the
most part of the lines and names distinctly.
She had heard it once before, and the
singer reported it to be a new song, and
the composition of a young man who had
afterwards been executed in the Grass&#8211;Market.
How Nanny came to sing such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
song, with so much seeming zest, after the
violent prelatic principles which she had
so lately avowed, the maid could not well
comprehend, and she began to suspect
that there was more in Nanny&#8217;s mind than
had yet been made manifest. Struck with
this thought, and ruminating upon it, she
continued standing in the same position,
and heard Nanny sometimes crooning, and
at other times talking rapidly and fervently
to herself. After much incoherent matter,
lines of psalms, &amp;c. Katharine heard
with astonishment the following questions
and answers, in which two distinct voices
were imitated:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you at the meeting of the traitors
at Lanark on the 12th of January?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never was amang traitors that I was
certain of till this day&#8212;Let them take
that! bloody fruesome beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you at Lanark on that day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been there you would have
seen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;D&#8209;&#8209;n the old b&#8209;&#8209;! Burn her with
matches&#8212;squeeze her with pincers as long
as there&#8217;s a whole piece of her together&#8212;then
throw her into prison, and let her lie
till she rot&#8212;the old wrinkled hag of h&#8209;&#8209;!
Good woman, I pity you; you shall yet go
free if you will tell us where you last saw
Hamilton and your own goodman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye sall hing me up by the tongue first,
and cut me a&#8217; in collops while I&#8217;m hingin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burn her in the cheek, cut baith her
lugs out, and let her gae to h&#8209;&#8209; her own
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this strange soliloquy, the speaker
sobbed aloud, spoke in a suppressed voice
for some time, and then began a strain so
sweet and melancholy, that it thrilled the
hearer, and made her tremble where she
stood. The tune was something like the
Broom of Cowdenknows, the sweetest and
most plaintive of the ancient Scottish airs;
but it was sung so slow, as to bear with it
a kind of solemnity.</p>

<p>The sentiments of old Nanny appeared
now to her young mistress to be more
doubtful than ever. Fain would she have
interpreted them to be such as she wished,
but the path which that young female was
now obliged to tread required a circumspection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
beyond her experience and discernment
to preserve, while danger and
death awaited the slightest deviation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Next morning Clavers, with fifty dragoons,
arrived at Chapelhope, where they
alighted on the green; and putting their
horses to forage, he and Sir Thomas Livingston,
Captain Bruce, and Mr Adam
Copland, before mentioned, a gentleman
of Clavers&#8217; own troop, went straight into
the kitchen. Walter was absent at the hill.
The goodwife was sitting lonely in the east
room, brooding over her trials and woes in
this life, and devising means to get rid of
her daughter, and with her of all the devouring
spirits that haunted Chapelhope; consequently
the first and only person whom
the gentlemen found in the kitchen was
old Nanny. Clavers, who entered first,
kept a shy and sullen distance, for he never
was familiar with any one; but Bruce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who was a jocular Irish gentleman, and
well versed in harassing and inveigling the
ignorant country people to their destruction,
made two low bows (almost to the
ground) to the astonished dame, and accosted
her as follows: &#8220;How are you to&#8211;day,
mistress?&#8212;I hope you are very well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye kindly, sir,&#8221; said Nanny,
curtseying in return; &#8220;deed I&#8217;m no sae
weel as I hae been; I hae e&#8217;en seen better
days; but I keep aye the heart aboon, although
the achings and the stitches hae
been sair on me the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lack&#8211;a&#8211;day! I am so very sorry for
that!&#8212;Where do they seize you? about
the heart, I suppose?&#8212;Oh, dear soul! to
be sure you do not know how sorry I am
for your case&#8212;it must be so terribly bad!
You should have the goodness to consult
your physician, and get blood let.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear bairn, I hae nae blude to spare&#8212;an&#8217;
as for doctors, I haena muckle to lippen
to them. To be sure, they are whiles the
means, under Providence&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; said he, putting his finger to his
nose, and turning to his associates with a
wry face,&#8212;&#8220;Oho! the means under Providence!&#8212;a
d&#8209;&#8209;d whig, by &#8209;&#8209;&#8209;&#8209;. Tell
me, my dear and beautiful Mistress Stitchaback,
do you really believe in that blessed
thing, Providence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I believe in Providence!&#8212;Did
ever ony body hear sic a question as that?
Gae away, ye muckle gouk&#8212;d&#8217;ye think to
make a fool of a puir body?&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, she gave him a hearty slap on
the cheek; at which his companions laughing,
Bruce became somewhat nettled, and,
drawing out his sword, he pointed at the
recent stains of blood upon it. &#8220;Be so
good as to look here, my good lady,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and take very good note of all
that I say, and more; for harkee, you must
either renounce Providence, and all that I
bid you renounce,&#8212;and you must, beside
that, answer all the questions that I shall
ever be after asking,&#8212;or, do you see, I am
a great doctor&#8212;this is my very elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
lance&#8212;and I&#8217;ll draw the blood that shall
soon ease you of all your stitches and
pains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dinna like your fleem ava, man&#8212;&#8217;tis
rather ower grit for an auld body&#8217;s veins.
But ye&#8217;re surely some silly skemp of a fallow,
to draw out your sword on a puir auld
woman. Dinna think, howanabee, that I
care for outher you or it. I&#8217;ll let ye see
how little I mind ye; for weel I ken your
comrades wadna let ye fash me, e&#8217;en though
ye were sae silly as to offer. Na, na; d&#8217;ye
ever think that little bonny demure&#8211;looking
lad there wad suffer ye to hurt a woman?&#8212;I
wat wad he no! He has mair discreation
in his little finger than you hae i&#8217; your hale
bouk.&#8212;Now try me, master doctor&#8212;I&#8217;ll
nouther renounce ae thing that ye bid me,
nor answer ae question that ye speer at
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, then, my good hearty
dame, do you acknowledge or renounce
the Covenant?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;Aha! he&#8217;s wise wha wats that, an&#8217; as
daft that speers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, or no, in a moment&#8212;No juggling
with me, old Mrs Skinflint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell ye what ye do, master&#8212;if ony
body speer at ye, gin auld Nanny i&#8217; the
Chapelhope renounces the Covenant, shake
your head an&#8217; say ye dinna ken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray, my very beautiful girl, what
do you keep this old tattered book for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a fancy to gar fools speer, an&#8217;
ye&#8217;re the first&#8212;Come on now, sir, wi&#8217; your
catechis&#8212;Wally&#8211;dye man! gin ye be nae
better a fighter than ye&#8217;re an examiner, ye
may gie up the craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruce here bit his lip, and looked so
stern that Nanny, with a hysterical laugh,
ran away from him, and took shelter behind
Clavers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a d&#8209;&#8209;d fool, Bruce,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and constantly blundering.&#8212;Our business
here, mistress, is to discover, if possible,
who were the murderers of an honest
curate, and some of our own soldiers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were slain in this neighbourhood while discharging
their duty; if you can give us
any information on that subject, you shall
be well rewarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll hear about the curate, sir&#8212;ye&#8217;ll
hear about him&#8212;he was found out to be a
warlock, and shot dead.&#8212;But ah, dear
bairn! nane alive can gie you information
about the soldiers!&#8212;It was nae human
hand did that deed, and there was nae e&#8217;e
out o&#8217; heaven saw it done&#8212;There wasna
a man that day in a&#8217; the Hope up an&#8217; down&#8212;that
deed will never be fund out, unless
a spirit rise frae the dead an&#8217; tell o&#8217;t&#8212;Muckle
fear, an&#8217; muckle grief it has been
the cause o&#8217; here!&#8212;But the men war a&#8217; decently
buried; what mair could be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you say that my men were all decently
buried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, troth, I wat weel, worthy sir, and
wi&#8217; the burial&#8211;service too.&#8212;My master and
mistress are strong king&#8217;s folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are not the mistress of this
house?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;A bonny like mistress I wad be, forsooth&#8212;Na,
na, my mistress is sittin be hersel
ben the house there.&#8221; With that, Nanny
fell a working and singing full loud&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Little wats she wha&#8217;s coming,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An&#8217; Donald Gun an&#8217; a&#8217;s coming.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Anxious now to explore the rest of the
house, they left Nanny singing her song,
and entered the little parlour hastily, where,
finding no one, and dreading that some
escape might be effected, Clavers and Livingston
burst into the Old Room, and
Bruce and Copland into the other. In the
Old Room they found the beautiful witch
Katharine, with the train of her snow&#8211;white
joup drawn over her head, who looked as
if taken in some evil act by surprise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
greatly confounded when she saw two gentlemen
enter her sanctuary in splendid uniforms.
As they approached, she made a
slight curtsey, to which they deigned no
return; but going straight up to her, Clavers
seized her by both wrists. &#8220;And is
it, indeed, true,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my beautiful
shepherdess, that we have caught you at
your prayers so early this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if you have, sir?&#8221; returned
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing at all, save that I earnestly
desire, and long exceedingly to join
with you in your devotional exercises,&#8221;
laying hold of her in the rudest manner.</p>

<p>Katharine screamed so loud that in an
instant old Nanny was at their side, with
revenge gleaming from her half&#8211;shaded eyes,
and heaving over her shoulder a large
green&#8211;kale gully, with which she would
doubtless have silenced the renowned Dundee
for ever, had not Livingston sprung
forward with the utmost celerity, and
caught her arm just as the stroke was descending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
But Nanny did not spare her
voice; she lifted it up with shouts on high,
and never suffered one yell to lose hearing
of another.</p>

<p>Walter, having just then returned from
the hill, and hearing the hideous uproar in
the Old Room, rushed into it forthwith to
see what was the matter. Katharine was
just sinking, when her father entered,
within the grasp of the gentle and virtuous
Clavers. The backs of both the knights
were towards Walter as he came in, and
they were so engaged amid bustle and din
that neither of them perceived him, until he
was close at their backs. He was at least a
foot taller than any of them, and nearly as
wide round the chest as them both. In one
moment his immense fingers grasped both
their slender necks, almost meeting behind
each of their windpipes. They were rendered
powerless at once&#8212;they attempted
no more struggling with the women, for so
completely had Walter&#8217;s gripes unnerved
them, that they could scarcely lift their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
arms from their sides; neither could they
articulate a word, or utter any other sound
than a kind of choaked gasping for breath.
Walter wheeled them about to the light,
and looked alternately at each of them,
without quitting or even slackening his
hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Callants, wha ir ye ava?&#8212;or what&#8217;s
the meanin&#8217; o&#8217; a&#8217; this unmencefu&#8217; rampaging?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Thomas gave his name in a hoarse
and broken voice; but Clavers, whose nape
Walter&#8217;s right hand embraced, and whose
rudeness to his daughter had set his mountain&#8211;blood
a&#8211;boiling, could not answer a
word. Walter, slackening his hold somewhat,
waited for an answer, but none coming&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha ir ye, I say, ye bit useless weazel&#8211;blawn
like urf that ye&#8217;re?&#8221;</p>

<p>The haughty and insolent Clavers was
stung with rage; but seeing no immediate
redress was to be had, he endeavoured to
pronounce his dreaded name, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in a whisper scarcely audible, and stuck in
his throat&#8212;&#8220;Jo&#8212;o&#8212;o Graham,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jock Graham do they ca&#8217; ye?&#8212;Ye&#8217;re
but an unmannerly whalp, man. And ye&#8217;re
baith king&#8217;s officers too!&#8212;Weel, I&#8217;ll tell
ye what it is, my denty clever callants; if
it warna for the blood that&#8217;s i&#8217; your master&#8217;s
veins, I wad nite your twa bits o&#8217; pows thegither.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then threw them from him; the one
the one way, and the other the other, and
lifting his huge oak staff, he strode out at
the door, saying, as he left them,&#8212;&#8220;Hech!
are free men to be guidit this gate&#8212;I&#8217;ll
step down to the green to your commander,
an&#8217; tell him what kind o&#8217; chaps he keeps
about him to send into fock&#8217;s houses.&#8212;Dirty
unmensefu&#8217; things!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clavers soon recovering his breath, and
being ready to burst with rage and indignation,
fell a cursing and fuming most violently;
but Sir T. Livingston could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
refrain from breaking out into a convulsion
of laughter. Clavers had already determined
upon ample revenge, for the violation
of all the tender ties of nature was
his delight, and wherever there was wealth
to be obtained, or a private pique to be revenged,
there never was wanting sufficient
pretext in those days for cutting off individuals,
or whole families, as it suited. On
the very day previous to that, the Earl of
Traquair had complained, in company with
Clavers and his officers, of a tenant of his,
in a place called Bald, who would neither
cultivate his farm nor give it up. Captain
Bruce asked if he prayed in his family?
The Earl answered jocularly, that he believed
he did nothing else. Bruce said
that was enough; and the matter passed
over without any farther notice. But next
morning, Bruce went out with four dragoons,
and shot the farmer as he was going
out to his work. Instances of this kind are
numerous, if either history or tradition can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
be in aught believed; but in all the annals
of that age, there is scarcely a single instance
recorded of any redress having been
granted to the harassed country people for
injuries received. At this time, the word
of Argyle&#8217;s rising had already spread, and
Clavers actually traversed the country more
like an exterminating angel, than a commander
of a civilized army.</p>

<p>Such were the men with whom Walter
had to do; and the worst thing of all, he
was not aware of it. He had heard of such
things, but he did not believe them; for
he loved his king and country, and there
was nothing that vexed him more than
hearing of aught to their disparagement;
but unluckily his notions of freedom and
justice were far above what the subjects of
that reign could count upon.</p>

<p>When Clavers and Livingstone entered
the Old Room, it will be remembered that
Bruce and Copland penetrated into the
other. There they found the goodwife of
Chapelhope, neatly dressed in her old&#8211;fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
style, and reading on her Bible,
an exercise in which she gloried, and of
which she was very proud.</p>

<p>Bruce instantly desired her &#8220;to lay that
very comely and precious book on the hottest
place of all the beautiful fire, that was
burning so pleasantly with long crackling
peat; and that then he would converse
with her about things that were, to be sure,
of far greater and mightier importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hout, dear sir, ye ken that&#8217;s no consistent
wi&#8217; natural reason&#8212;Can any thing
be o&#8217; greater importance than the tidings
o&#8217; grace an&#8217; salvation, an&#8217; the joys o&#8217; heaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; cried Bruce, and straddled
around the room with his face turned to
the joists.&#8212;&#8220;My dear Copland, did you
ever hear such a thing in all the days that
ever you have to live? Upon my soul, the
old woman is talking of grace, and salvation,
and the joys of heaven too, by Saint
G&#8209;&#8209;! My dearest honey and darling, will
you be so kind as stand up upon the soles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of your feet, and let me see what kind of a
figure you will be in heaven. Now, by
the cross of Saint Patrick, I would take
a journey there to see you go swimming
through Heaven in that same form, with
your long waist, and plaitted quoif, and
that same charming face of yours. Och!
och! me! what a vile she whig we have
got in this here corner!&#8212;Copland, my
dear soul, I foresee that all the ewes and
kine of Chapelhope will soon be rouped at
the cross of Selkirk, and then what blessed
lawings we shall have! Now my dear mistress
Grace, you must be after renouncing
the joys of heaven immediately; for upon
my honour, the very sight of your face
would spoil the joys of any place whatever,
and the first thing you must do is to lay
that delightful old book with the beautiful
margin along the side of it, on the coals;
but before you do that we shall sing to his
praise and glory from the 7th verse of the
149th psalm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then laid aside his helmet and sung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the psalm, giving out each line with a whine
that was truly ludicrous, after which he put
the Bible into the goodwife&#8217;s hand, and desired
her, in a serious tone, instantly to lay it
on the fire. The captain&#8217;s speech to his companions
about the ewes and kine of Chapelhope
was not altogether lost on the conscience
of Maron Linton. It was not, as
she afterwards said, like water spilt upon
the ground, which cannot be gathered up
again. &#8220;Why, dear sir,&#8221; said she, &#8220;ye
ken, after a&#8217;, that the beuk&#8217;s naething but
paper an&#8217; ink, an&#8217; three shillings an&#8217; aughtpence
will buy as gude a ane frae Geordy
Dabson, the morn, an&#8217; if there be ony sin
in&#8217;t, it will lye at your door, an&#8217; no at mine.
I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er haigel wi&#8217; my king&#8217;s officer about
three and aughtpence.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Maron laid the Bible on the
fire, which soon consumed it to ashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, may the devil take me,&#8221; said
Bruce, &#8220;if I do not believe that you are a
true woman after all, and if so, my purse is
lighter by one half than it was; but, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
dear honey, you have the very individual
and genuine seeds of whiggism in your constitution&#8212;You
have, I will swear, been at
many a harmless and innocent conventicle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye ken little about me, sir.&#8212;Gude
forbid that ever I countenanced sic traitors
to the kirk and state!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen! say I; but I prophecy and
say unto thee, that the first field&#8211;meeting
into which thou goest in the beauty of holiness,
thou shalt be established for ever
with thy one foot in Dan and the other in
Beersheba, and shalt return to thy respective
place of abode as rank a whig as ever
swung in the Grass&#8211;Market.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long dialogue next ensued, in which
the murder of the priest, Mass John Binram,
was discussed at full length, and by which
Bruce and Copland discerned, that superstitious
as Maron was, she told them what she
deemed to be the truth, though in a strange
round&#8211;about way. Just as they were beginning
to talk over the mysterious murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the soldiers, Claverhouse and Sir Thomas
joined them, and Bruce, turning round to
them, said, &#8220;My lord, this very honest
woman assures me, that she believes the
two principal murderers of the curate are
lying concealed in a linn not far hence,
and there seems to be little doubt but that
they must likewise have been concerned in
the murder of our soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clavers, the horrors of whose execrations
are yet fresh in the memory of our peasants,
burst out as follows, to the astonishment
of Bruce, who was not aware of his chagrin,
or of aught having befallen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;May the devil confound and d&#8209;&#8209;n
them to hell!&#8212;May he make a brander of
their ribs to roast their souls on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Maron Linton, hearing herself called a
good woman, and finding that she was approven
of, could not refrain from interfering
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear sir, my lord, ye sudna swear that
gate, for it&#8217;s unco ill&#8211;faur&#8217;d ye ken&#8212;an&#8217; at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
ony rate, the deil canna damn naebody&#8212;if
ye will swear, swear sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rage of the general, and the simplicity
of the goodwife, was such an amusing
contrast, that the three attendants laughed
aloud. Clavers turned his deep grey eye
upon them, which more than the eye of any
human being resembled that of a serpent&#8212;offence
gleamed in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;do you consider
where you are, and what you are about?
Sacre! am I always to be trysted with boys
and fools?&#8221;</p>

<p>He then began and examined the goodwife
with much feigned deference and civility,
which so pleased her that she told
him every thing with great readiness. She
was just beginning to relate the terrible,
but unfortunate story of the Brownie of
Bodsbeck, and his train of officious spirits;
of the meat which they devoured, and in
all probability would have ended the relation
with the woeful connection between
the Brownie and her daughter, and the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that she had taken in the murder of the
soldiers, when Walter entered the room
with a discomposed mien, and gave a new
turn to the conversation. But that eventful
scene must be left to the next chapter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>Walter, on coming to the troopers and
asking for their leader, soon discovered
how roughly he had treated Clavers; and
it being so much the reverse of the reception
he meant to have given him, he was
particularly vexed about it. Still he was
conscious that he had done nothing that
was wrong, nor any thing that it did not
behove a parent and a master of a family
to have done in the same circumstances;
therefore there was nothing farther from
his intention than offering any apology.
He entered his own room, as he supposed
he had a good right to do, bluntly enough.
He indeed touched the rim of his bonnet
as he came in; but, seeing all the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
covered, he stalked into the midst of them
with that immense circle of blue woollen
on his head, which moved over their helmets
like a black cloud as he advanced.
Bruce, who was well used to insult the
peasantry with impunity, seeing Walter striding
majestically by his general in this
guise, with his wonted forwardness and jocularity
lifted up his sword, sheathed as it
was, and with the point of it kicked off
Walter&#8217;s bonnet. The latter caught it again
as it fell, and with his fist, he made Bruce&#8217;s
helmet ring against the wall; then again
fitting on his bonnet, he gave him such an
indignant and reproving look, that Bruce,
having no encouragement from the eye of
Clavers, resented it no farther than by saying
good&#8211;humouredly, &#8220;&#8216;Pon my body and
shoul, but the carle keeps his good&#8211;looking
head high enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Copland,&#8221; said Clavers, &#8220;desire Serjeant
Daniel Roy Macpherson, with eleven
troopers, to attend.&#8221; They were instantly
at the door. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;Seize and pinion that
haughty rebel, together with all his family,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and then go and search
every corner, chest, and closet in the
house; for it is apparent that this is the
nest and rendezvous of the murdering fanatics
who infest this country. Let the
rest of the soldiers guard the premises,
that none escape to the mountains with
tidings of our arrival. This good dame
we will first examine privately, and then
dispose of her as shall seem most meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The command was promptly obeyed.
Walter and all his family were taken into
custody, pinioned, and a guard set on
them; the house was ransacked; and in
the meantime the general and his three
associates continued the examination of
the goodwife. Clavers observed that, on
the entrance of Walter before, she seemed
to be laid under some restraint, stopped
short in her narration, and said, &#8220;But
there&#8217;s the gudeman; he&#8217;ll tell ye it wi&#8217;
mair preceesion nor me;&#8221; and he had no
doubt, if she were left to herself, of worming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as much out of her as would condemn
her husband, or at least furnish a pretext
sufficient for the forfeiture of his wealth.
Clavers had caused to be sold, by public
roup, the whole stock on the farm of Phillhope,
which belonged to Walter&#8217;s brother&#8211;in&#8211;law,
merely because it was proven that
the farmer&#8217;s wife had once been at a conventicle.</p>

<p>In the present instance, however, Clavers
was mistaken, and fairly overshot his
mark; for poor Maron Linton was so overwhelmed
with astonishment when she saw
her husband and family taken prisoners
and bound, that her speech lost all manner
of coherence. She sobbed aloud&#8212;complained
one while, entreated another; and
then muttered over some ill&#8211;sorted phrases
from the Scripture. When Clavers pressed
his questions, she answered him, weeping,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&#8220;O dear sir, my lord, ye ken I canna do
naething, nor think naething, nor answer
naething, unless ye let Watie loose again;
I find as I war naebody, nor nae soul, nor
naething ava wantin&#8217; him, but just like a
vacation or a shadow. O my lord, set my
twa bits o&#8217; callants an&#8217; my puir auld man
loose again, and I&#8217;ll say ony thing that ever
ye like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Threats and proffers proved alike in vain.
Maron&#8217;s mind, which never was strong, had
been of late so much unhinged by the terrors
of superstition, that it wavered in its
frail tenement like &#8220;the baseless fabric of
a vision,&#8221; threatening to depart, and leave
not a wreck behind. Clavers told her that
her husband&#8217;s life depended on the promptness
and sincerity of her answers, he having
rendered himself amenable to justice by
rescuing his daughter by force, whom they
had taken prisoner on their arrival, having
found her engaged in a very suspicious employment.
This only increased Maron&#8217;s
agony; and at length Clavers was obliged
to give up the point, and ordered her into
custody.</p>

<p>The soldiers had by this time taken old
John of the Muchrah and another of Laidla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>w&#8217;s
shepherds prisoners, who had come to
assist their master with the farm&#8211;work that
day. All these Clavers examined separately;
and their answers, as taken down in
short&#8211;hand by Mr Adam Copland, are still
extant, and at present in my possession.
The following are some of them, as decyphered
by Mr J. W. Robertson, whose acquaintance
with ancient manuscripts is well
known.</p>

<p>John Hay, shepherd in Muchrah, aged
fifty&#8211;six, sworn and examined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know such a man as the Rev.
James Renwick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I once heard him pray and preach
for about the space of two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it on your master&#8217;s farm that he
preached?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it was in a linn on the Earl Hill,
in the march between two lairds&#8217; lands,
that he preached that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How durst you go to an unlawful conventicle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didna ken there was a law against it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
till after&#8212;it&#8217;s a wild place this&#8212;we never
hear ony o&#8217; the news, unless it be twice a&#8211;year
frae the Moffat fairs. But as soon as
I heard him praying and preaching against
the king I cam aff an&#8217; left him, an&#8217; brought
a&#8217; my lads an&#8217; lasses wi&#8217; me; but my wife
wadna steer her fit&#8212;there she sat, shaking
her head and glooming at me; but I trow
I cowed her for&#8217;t after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say of the king?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I canna mind&#8212;he said nae muckle
gude o&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say that he was a bloody perjured
tyrant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, he said muckle waur nor that. He
said some gayan ill&#8211;farr&#8217;d things about him.
But I cam away and left him; I thought
he was saying mair than gude manners
warrantit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you in the Hope, as you call it;
on that day that the king&#8217;s soldiers were
slain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that I was; I was the first wha
came on them whan they war just new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dead, an&#8217; a&#8217; reeking i&#8217; their warm blude&#8212;Gude
keep us a&#8217; frae sic sights again!&#8212;for
my part, I never gat sic a confoundit gliff
sin&#8217; I was born o&#8217; my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Describe the place where the corpses
were lying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a deep cleuch, wi&#8217; a sma&#8217; sheep
rodding through the linn not a foot wide;
and if ye war to stite aff that, ye wad gang
to the boddom o&#8217; the linn wi&#8217; a flaip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were the bodies then lying in the bottom
of that linn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd help ye, whar could they be lying
else?&#8212;D&#8217;ye think they could lie on the
Cleuch&#8211;brae? Ye might as weel think to
lie on the side o&#8217; that wa&#8217; gin ye war
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it appear to you that they
had been slain&#8212;were they cut with swords,
or pierced with bullets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I canna say, but they war sair hashed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean when you say they
were hashed?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&#8220;Champit like&#8212;a&#8217; broozled and jurmummled,
as it war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that they were cut, or
cloven, or minced?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na&#8212;no that ava&#8212;But they had
gotten some sair doofs&#8212;They had been
terribly paikit and daddit wi&#8217; something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not in the least conceive what
you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s extrordnar, man&#8212;can ye no understand
folk&#8217;s mother&#8211;tongue?&#8212;I&#8217;ll mak
it plain to you. Ye see, whan a thing
comes on ye that gate, that&#8217;s a dadd&#8212;sit
still now. Then a paik, that&#8217;s a swapp or a
skelp like&#8212;when a thing comes on ye that
way, that&#8217;s a paik. But a doof&#8217;s warst ava&#8212;it&#8217;s&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prithee hold; I now understand it all
perfectly well.&#8212;What, then, is your opinion
with regard to these men&#8217;s death?
How, or what way do you think they were
killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, sir, there&#8217;s naebody can say. It was
some extrordnar judgment, that&#8217;s out of a&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
doubt. There had been an unyerdly raid
i&#8217; the Hope that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason have you for supposing
such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there wasna a leevin soul i&#8217;
the hale Hope that day but theirsels&#8212;they
wadna surely hae felled ane another&#8212;It&#8217;s,
by an&#8217; attour, an awsome bit where they
war killed; there hae been things baith
seen and heard about it; and I saw an apparition
there mysel on the very night before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw an apparition at the place the
night before, did you? And, pray, what
was that apparition like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was like a man and a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had the figure of the woman no resemblance
to any one you had ever seen
before? Was it in any degree, for instance,
like your master&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No unlike ava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think I can guess what the
other form was like&#8212;Had it a bonnet on
its head?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;Not a bonnet certainly, but it had the
shape o&#8217; ane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I weened as much&#8212;And was it a tall
gigantic figure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na, sir; the very contrair o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you certain of that you say? Was
it not taller than the apparition of the woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No half sae tall, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had it not some slight resemblance to
your master, little as it was? Did that not
strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, na, it was naething like my master,
nor nae yerdly creature that ever was seen;
indeed it was nae creature ava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then do you suppose it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord kens!&#8212;A wraith, I hae little
doubt. My een rins a&#8217; wi&#8217; water whan I
think about it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wraiths are quite common here, are
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes, sir!&#8212;oure common. They appear
aye afore death, especially if the death
be to be sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&#8220;And what are they generally like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes like a light&#8212;sometimes
like a windin&#8211;sheet&#8212;sometimes like the
body that&#8217;s to dee, gaen mad&#8212;and sometimes
like a coffin made o&#8217; moon&#8211;light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it in the evening you saw this apparition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a little after midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray, what might be your business
in such a place at that untimely hour?&#8212;Explain
that fully to me if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sall do that, sir, as weel as I can:&#8212;Our
ewes, ye see, lie up in the twa Grains
an&#8217; the Middle a&#8217; the harst&#8212;Now, the Quave
Brae again, it&#8217;s our hogg&#8211;fence, that&#8217;s the
hained grund like; and whenever the wind
gangs easterly about, then whan the auld
luckies rise i&#8217; the howe o&#8217; the night to get
their rug, aff they come, snouckin a&#8217; the
way to the Lang Bank, an&#8217; the tither end
o&#8217; them round the Piper Snout, and into the
Quave Brae to the hained grund; an&#8217; very
often they think naething o&#8217; landing i&#8217; the
mids o&#8217; the corn. Now I never mindit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
corn sae muckle; but for them to gang wi&#8217;
the hogg&#8211;fence, I coudna bide that ava;
for ye ken, sir, how coud we turn our hand
wi&#8217; our pickle hoggs i&#8217; winter if their bit
foggage war a&#8217; riven up by the auld raikin
hypalts ere ever a smeary&#8217;s clute clattered
on&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Clavers was generally of an impatient
temper, and loathed the simplicity
of nature, yet he could not help smiling at
this elucidation, which was much the same
to him as if it had been delivered in the language
of the Moguls; but seeing the shepherd
perfectly sincere, he suffered him to
go on to the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir, ye ken the wind very often
taks a swee away round to the east i&#8217; the
night&#8211;time whan the wather&#8217;s gude i&#8217; the
harst months, an&#8217; whanever this was the
case, and the moon i&#8217; the lift, I had e&#8217;en
aye obliged to rise at midnight, and gang
round the hill an&#8217; stop the auld kimmers&#8212;very
little did the turn&#8212;just a bit thraw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
yont the brae, an&#8217; they kend my whistle, or
my tike&#8217;s bark, as weel as I did mysel, still
they wadna do wantin&#8217;t. Weel, ye see, sir,
I gets up an&#8217; gangs to the door&#8212;it was a
bonny night&#8212;the moon was hingin o&#8217;er the
derk brows o&#8217; Hopertoody, an&#8217; the lang
black scaddaws had an eiry look&#8212;I turned
my neb the tither gate, an&#8217; I fand the air
was gane to the eissel; the se&#8217;en starns had
gaen oure the lum, an&#8217; the tail o&#8217; the king&#8217;s
elwand was just pointin to the Muchrah
Crags. It&#8217;s the very time, quo&#8217; I to mysel,
I needna think about lying down again&#8212;I
maun leave Janet to lie doverin by hersel
for an hour or twa&#8212;Keilder, my fine dog,
where are ye?&#8212;He was as ready as me&#8212;he
likes a play i&#8217; the night&#8211;time brawly, for
he&#8217;s aye gettin a broostle at a hare, or a tod,
or a foumart, or some o&#8217; thae beasts that
gang snaikin about i&#8217; the derk. Sae to mak
a lang tale short, sir, off we sets, Keilder an&#8217;
me, an&#8217; soon comes to the place. The ewes
had been very mensefu&#8217; that night, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
had just comed to the march and nae farther;
sae, I says, puir things, sin&#8217; ye hae
been sae leifu&#8217;, we&#8217;ll sit down an&#8217; rest a
while, the dog an&#8217; me, an&#8217; let ye tak a pluck
an&#8217; fill yersels or we turn ye back up to your
cauld lairs again. Sae down we sits i&#8217; the
scaddaw of a bit derksome cleuch&#8211;brae&#8212;naebody
could hae seen us; and ere ever I
wats, I hears by the grumblin o&#8217; my friend,
that he outher saw or smelled something
mair than ordinar. I took him in aneath
my plaid for fear o&#8217; some grit brainyell of
an outbrik; and whan I lookit, there was a
white thing and a black thing new risen
out o&#8217; the solid yird! They cam close by
me; and whan I saw the moon shinin on
their cauld white faces, I lost my sight an&#8217;
swarfed clean away. Wae be to them for
droichs, or ghaists, or whatever they war,
for aye sin&#8217; syne the hogg&#8211;fence o&#8217; the
Quave Brae has been harried an&#8217; traisselled
till its little better nor a drift road&#8212;I darna
gang an&#8217; stop the ewes now for the saul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that&#8217;s i&#8217; my bouk, an&#8217; little do I wat what&#8217;s
to come o&#8217; the hoggs the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, you have explained this
much I believe to your own satisfaction&#8212;Remember
then, you are upon oath&#8212;Who
do you think it was that killed these men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was outher God or the deil,
but whilk o&#8217; them, I coudna say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is really your opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen any strangers about
your master&#8217;s house of late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw one not long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a man was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A douse&#8211;looking man wi&#8217; a brown yaud;
I took him for some wool&#8211;buyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he not rather like a preacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man might hae preached for aught
contrair till&#8217;t in his appearance&#8212;I coudna
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you certain it was not Mr Renwick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;Is your master a very religious man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s weel eneugh that way&#8212;No that
very reithe on&#8217;t; but the gudewife hauds
his neb right sair to the grindstane about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he perform family worship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he reckoned a great and exemplary
performer of that duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, he&#8217;s nae great gun, I trow; but he
warstles away at it as weel as he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you repeat any part, or any particular
passage of his usual prayer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I might, for he gangs often
aneuch oure some o&#8217; them. Let me see&#8212;there&#8217;s
the still waters, and the green pastures,
and the blood of bulls and of goats;
and then there&#8217;s the gos&#8211;hawk, and the slogy
riddle, and the tyrant an&#8217; his lang neb;
I hae the maist o&#8217;t i&#8217; my head, but then I
canna mouband it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he mean by the tyrant and
his long neb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! But that&#8217;s mair nor ever I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
find out yet. We whiles think he means
the Kelpy&#8212;him that raises the storms an&#8217;
the floods on us, ye ken, and gars the waters
an&#8217; the burns come roarin down wi&#8217;
bracks o&#8217; ice an&#8217; snaw, an&#8217; tak away our
sheep. But whether it&#8217;s Kelpy, or Clavers,
or the Deil, we can never be sure, for we
think it applies gay an&#8217; weel to them a&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat the passage as well as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring down the tyrant an&#8217; his lang neb,
for he has done muckle ill this year, and
gie him a cup o&#8217; thy wrath; an&#8217; gin he
winna tak that, gie him kelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is meant by kelty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s double&#8212;it means twa cups&#8212;ony
body kens that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he ever mention the king in his
prayer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes: always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he say about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something about the sceptre of righteousness,
and the standard of truth. I ken
he has some rhyme about him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;Indeed! And does he likewise make
mention of the Covenant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s after&#8212;that&#8217;s near the end,
just afore the resurrection. O yes, he harls
aye in the Covenant there. &#8216;The bond o&#8217;
the everlasting Covenant,&#8217; as he ca&#8217;s it, weel
ordered in all things, and sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s very well; that&#8217;s quite sufficient.
Now, you have yourself confessed,
that you were at an unlawful and abominable
conventicle, holding fellowship with intercommuned
rebels, along with your wife
and family. You <i>must</i> be made an example
of to the snarling and rebellious hounds
that are lurking in these bounds; but as
you have answered me with candour, though
I might order you instantly to be shot, I
will be so indulgent as to give you your
choice, whether you will go to prison in
Edinburgh, and be there tried by the Council,
or submit to the judgment which I may
pronounce on you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, sir, I canna win to Edinbrough at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
no rate&#8212;that&#8217;s impossible. What think ye
wad come o&#8217; the sheep? The hogg&#8211;fence o&#8217;
the Quave Brae is maistly ruined already;
and war I to gae to the prison at Edinbrough,
it wad be mair loss than a&#8217; that I&#8217;m
worth. I maun just lippen to yoursel; but
ye maunna be very sair on me. I never did
ony ill designedly; and as for ony rebellion
against the Bruce&#8217;s blood, I wad be hangit
or I wad think o&#8217; sic a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the old ignorant animal away&#8212;Burn
him on the cheek, cut off his ears,
and do not part with him till he pay you
down a fine of two hundred merks, or value
to that amount. And, do you hear,
make him take all the oaths twice; and a
third oath, that he is never to repent of
these. By G&#8209;&#8209;; if either Monmouth or
Argyle get him, they shall have a perjured
dog of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As John was dragged off to this punishment,
which was executed without any mitigation,
he shook his head and said, &#8220;Ah,
lak&#8211;a day! I fear things are muckle waur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
wi&#8217; us than I had ony notion o&#8217;! I trowed
aye that even down truth an&#8217; honesty bure
some respect till now&#8212;I fear our country&#8217;s
a&#8217; wrang thegither.&#8221;&#8212;Then looking back
to Clavers, he added, &#8220;Gude&#8211;sooth, lad,
but ye&#8217;ll mak mae whigs wherever ye show
your face, than a&#8217; the hill preachers o&#8217; Scotland
put thegither.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>It has been remarked by all the historians
of that period, that the proceedings
of Clavers about this time were severe in
the extreme. The rising, both in the north
and south at the same time, rendered the
situation of affairs somewhat ticklish. Still
the Lowlands were then perfectly peaceable;
but he seemed determined, lest he
should be called away, to destroy the Covenanters,
and all that hankered after civil
and religious liberty, root and branch. Certainly
his behaviour at Chapelhope that
morning, was sufficient to stamp his character
for ever in that district, where it is
still held in at least as great detestation as
that of the arch&#8211;fiend himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>When the soldiers, by his order, seized
and manacled Walter, he protested vehemently
against such outrage, and urged
the general to prove his fidelity to his sovereign
by administering to him the test
oath, and the oath of abjuration; but this
Clavers declined, and said to him, with a
sneer, that &#8220;they had other ways of trying
dogs beside that.&#8221;</p>

<p>When those who had been appointed to
search the house came before him, and gave
in their report, among other things, they
said they had found as much bread new
baked, and mutton newly cooked, as would
be a reasonable allowance for an hundred
men for at least one whole day. Clavers
remarked, that in a family so few in number,
this was proof positive that others
were supported from that house. &#8220;But we
shall disappoint the whigs of one hearty
meal,&#8221; added he; and with that he ordered
the meat to be brought all out and set
down upon the green&#8212;bid his troopers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
eat as much as they could&#8212;feed their
horses with the bread which they left, and
either destroy the remainder of the victuals
or carry them away.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Walter told him the
honest truth, that the food was provided
solely for himself and his soldiers, as he
knew they were to come by that road, either
on that day or the one following;
nay, though all the family avouched it, as
they well might, he only remarked, with a
look of the utmost malignity, that &#8220;he never
in his life knew a whig who had not
a d&#8209;&#8209;d lie ready on his tongue, or some
kind of equivocation to save his stinking
life, but that they must necessarily all be
taught who they were dealing with.&#8221; He
then made them all swear that they were
to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, and to utter the most
horrid imprecations on themselves and their
souls for ever, if they deviated in one single
item; and beginning with old John, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
before related, he examined them all separately
and out of hearing of one another.</p>

<p>The interrogations and answers are much
too long to be inserted here at full length;
but the only new circumstances that came
to light were these two. One of the young
men deponed, that, when the bodies of the
soldiers were found in the Hope, their muskets
were all loaded, which showed that
they had not fallen in a regular skirmish;
and the other boy swore, that he had lately
seen eighty large thick bannocks baked in
one day in his father&#8217;s house, for that he had
counted them three times over as they stood
cooling. This was another suspicious circumstance,
and Clavers determined to search
it to the bottom. He sifted the two youths
backward and forward, trying to get the
secret out of them by every wile in his
power; and because they were unable to
give him any satisfactory account who consumed
all that store of bread, he caused his
dragoons to take hold of the youngest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
gird his head with a cord, twisting it with
a horse pistol, until in some places it cut
him to the skull. The eldest he hung up
to the beam by the thumbs until he fainted
through insufferable pain; but he could
get nothing more out of them, for they had
at first told him all that they knew, being
quite unconscious of any evil.</p>

<p>Still bent, as it seemed, on the full conviction
and ruin of the family, he told the
boys that they were two of the most consummate
knaves and rebels that he had in
all his life seen; and that if they had any
hopes at all of going to Heaven, they should
say their prayers, for in a few minutes he
would order them both to be shot.</p>

<p>John, the eldest, who possessed a good
deal of his mother&#8217;s feebleness of character,
and was besides but newly recovered
from a fainting fit, was seized with a
stupor, appeared quite passive, and acted
precisely as they bade him, without seeming
to know what he did; but the youngest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
whose name was William, preserved an
interesting firmness, in such a trial, for a
considerable time. On being advised by
Clavers to tell all he knew rather than die,
and asked if he was not afraid of death?
He answered, with the tear in his eye, &#8220;I&#8217;m
nouther feared for you nor death, man. I
think if fock may be guidit this way at their
ain hames, the sooner they&#8217;re dead the better.&#8221;
Then turning his looks to his brother,
who kneeled according to the general&#8217;s order
on the green beside him, he added, with
convulsive sobs, &#8220;But poor Jock&#8217;s gaun to
be shot too&#8212;I wonder what ye need kill
him for?&#8212;What ill hae we ever done t&#8217;ye?&#8212;Jock&#8217;s
a very good callant&#8212;I canna pray
weel, but if ye&#8217;ll let my billy Jock gang, I&#8217;ll
pray for ye as I can, and kiss ye too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happy was it for the wits of poor Maron
that she saw nothing of this touching scene;
she, as well as Walter, being then with the
rest under a strong guard in the Old Room.
Clavers paid no regard to the kneeling bo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>y&#8217;s
request. He caused his troopers to draw
up around them, present their firelocks,
and then an executioner, who was always
one of his train, tied up both their eyes.
He gave the word himself, and instantly ten
or twelve carabines were discharged on
them at once. John fell flat on the earth;
but William, with a violent start, sprung to
his feet, and, being blindfolded, ran straight
on the files of soldiers.</p>

<p>Clavers laid hold of him. &#8220;My brave
little fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the soldiers have
all missed you, bungling beasts that they
are! and since so wonderful a thing hath
befallen, you shall yet have your life, though
a most notorious rebel, if you will tell me
what people frequent your father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s comed o&#8217; Jock?&#8221; said the boy,
&#8220;O tell me what&#8217;s comed o&#8217; Jock, for I
canna see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jock is lying dead on the green there,
all bathed in his blood,&#8221; said Clavers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&#8220;poor wretch! it is over with him, and
unless you instantly tell me who it was that
consumed all that store of bread that has
been baked in your father&#8217;s house for the
last month, you must be sent after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>William withdrew backward a few paces,
and kneeling a second time down on the
sward with great decency and deliberation,
&#8220;Shoot again,&#8221; said he; &#8220;try me aince
mair; an&#8217; O see to airch a wee better this
time. I wad rather dee a hunder times, or
I saw poor Jock lying a bloody corp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clavers made a sign to one of his dragoons,
who unbound William, and took the
bandage from his eyes. Regardless of all
else, he looked wildly around in search of
his brother, and seeing his only companion
lying flat on his face, he at first turned
away, as if wishing to escape from a scene
so dismal; but his helpless and forlorn situation
staring him in the face, and the
idea doubtless recurring that he was never
to part with his brother, but forthwith to
be slaughtered and carried to the grave with
him, he returned, went slowly up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
body, kneeled down beside it, and pulling
the napkin farther down over the face to
keep the dead features from view, he clasped
his arms about his brother&#8217;s neck, laid
his cheek to his, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>The narrator of this part of the tale was
wont to say, that the scene which followed
had something more touching in it than any
tongue could describe, although Clavers
and his troops only laughed at it. William
had now quite relinquished all sensations of
fear or danger, and gave full vent to a flood
of passionate tenderness and despair. He
clasped his brother&#8217;s neck closer and closer,
steeped his cheek with his tears, and seemed
to cling and grow to the body with a
miserable fondness. While he was giving
full scope in this manner to the affections
of his young heart, his brother made a heave
up with his head and shoulder, saying at
the same time, like one wakening from a
dream, &#8220;Little Will, is that you?&#8212;Haud
aff&#8212;What ails ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>William raised up his head,&#8212;fixed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
eyes on vacancy,&#8212;the tears dried on his
cheek, and his ruby lips were wide open,&#8212;the
thing was beyond his comprehension,
and never was seen a more beautiful statue
of amazement. He durst not turn his eyes
towards his brother, but he uttered in words
scarcely articulate, &#8220;Lord! I believe they
hae missed Jock too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clavers had given private orders to his
dragoons to fire over the heads of the two
boys, his intent being to intimidate them
so much as to eradicate every principle of
firmness and power of concealment from
their tender minds; a scheme of his own
fertile invention, and one which he often
practised upon young people with too sure
effect. When William found that his brother
was really alive, and that both of them
were to be spared on condition that he
gave up the names and marks of all the
people that had of late been at Chapelhope;
he set himself with great earnestness
to recount them, along with every mark by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
which he remembered them, determined
that every hidden thing should be brought
to light, rather than that poor Jock should
be shot at again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weel, ye see, first there was Geordie
Skin&#8211;him&#8211;alive the flesher, him that took
away the crocks and the paulies, and my
brockit&#8211;lamb, and gae me a penny for setting
him through atween the lochs. Then there
was Hector Kennedy the tinkler, him that
the bogles brought and laid down at the
door i&#8217; the night&#8211;time&#8212;he suppit twa bickerfu&#8217;s
o&#8217; paritch, an&#8217; cleekit out a hantle o&#8217;
geds an&#8217; perches wi&#8217; his toum. Then there
was Ned Huddersfield the woo&#8211;man, wi&#8217;
the leather bags and the skeenzie thread&#8212;him
that kissed our bire&#8211;woman i&#8217; the barn
in spite o&#8217; her teeth,&#8212;he had red cheeks
and grit thees, and wasna unlike a glutton;
he misca&#8217;d my father&#8217;s woo, an&#8217; said aye,
&#8216;Nay, it&#8217;s nane clean, howsomever,&#8212;it&#8217;s
useless, that&#8217;s its warst fault.&#8217; Then there
was wee Willie the nout herd, him that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the gude knife an&#8217; the duddy breeks; but
the Brownie&#8217;s put him daft, an&#8217; his mither
had to come an&#8217; tak him away upon a
cuddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this manner went he on particularizing
every one he remembered, till fairly
cut short with a curse. John continued
perfectly stupid, and when examined, answered
only <i>Yes</i>, or <i>No</i>, as their way of
asking the question dictated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there not great numbers of people
who frequent your father&#8217;s house during
the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see and hear them, after you
go to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they generally employed in
when you hear them? Do they read, and
pray, and sing psalms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your father and mother always join
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>Here William could restrain himself no
longer. &#8220;Gude faith, Jock, man,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;ye&#8217;re just telling a hirsel o&#8217; eindown lees.
It canna be lees that the man wants, for
that maks him nae the wiser; an&#8217; for you
to say that my father rises to pray i&#8217; the
night&#8211;time, beats a&#8217;, when ye ken my mither
has baith to fleitch an&#8217; fight or she can get
him eggit on till&#8217;t i&#8217; the Sabbath e&#8217;enings.
He&#8217;s ower glad to get it foughten decently
by, to rise an&#8217; fa&#8217; till&#8217;t again. O fye, Jock!
I wad stand by the truth; an&#8217;, at ony rate,
no just gaung to hell open mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the volley of musketry went off,
all the prisoners started and stared on one
another; even the hundred veterans that
guarded them appeared by their looks to
be wholly at a loss. Macpherson alone ventured
any remark on it. &#8220;Pe Cot&#8217;s life,
fat she pe pluff pluffing at now? May the
teal more pe her soul&#8217;s salvation, if she do
not believe te man&#8217;s pe gone out of all reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The women screamed; and Maron, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tongue was a mere pendulum to the workings
of the heart within, went on sighing
and praying; asking questions, and answering
them alternately; and at every pause,
looked earnestly to her husband, who leaned
against the corner of the room, ashamed
that his bound hands should be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Och! Aigh me!&#8221; cried Maron,&#8212;&#8220;Dear
sirs, what&#8217;s the fock shootin at?&#8212;Eh?&#8212;I&#8217;m
sure they hae nae battlers to
fight wi&#8217; there?&#8212;No ane&#8212;I wat, no ane.
Aigh now, sirs! the lives o&#8217; God&#8217;s creatures!&#8212;They
never shoot nae callants, do
they? Oh, na, na, they&#8217;ll never shoot innocent
bairns, puir things! They&#8217;ll maybe
hae been trying how weel they could vizy
at the wild ducks; there&#8217;s a hantle o&#8217; cleckins
about the saughs o&#8217; the lake. Hout
ay, that&#8217;s a&#8217;.&#8212;He hasna forgotten to be
gracious, nor is his mercy clean gane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus poor Maron went on, and though
she had but little discernment left, she perceived
that there was a tint of indignant
madness in her husband&#8217;s looks. His lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
quivered&#8212;his eyes dilated&#8212;and the wrinkles
on his brow rolled up to the roots of
his dark grizzled hair, &#8220;Watie,&#8221; cried
she, in a shrill and tremulous voice&#8212;&#8220;Watie,
what ails ye&#8212;Oh! tell me what ails ye,
Watie?&#8212;What&#8217;s the fock shooting at? Eh?
Ye&#8217;ll no tell me what they&#8217;re shooting at,
Watie?&#8212;Oh, oh, oh, oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter uttered no word, nor did his
daughter, who sat in dumb astonishment,
with her head almost bent to her feet; but
old Nanny joined in full chorus with her
mistress, and a wild unearthly strain the
couple raised, till checked by Serjeant Roy
Macpherson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cot&#8217;s curse be t&#8209;&#8209;ning you to te everlasting
teal! fat too&#8211;whooing pe tat? Do
you think that should the lenoch beg pe

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>Upon the whole, there was no proof
against Walter. Presumption was against
him, but the evidence was rather in his favour.
Military law, however, prevailed;
and he found that there was no redress to
be had of any grievance or insult, that this
petty tyrant, in his caprice, thought fit to
inflict. His drivers were ordered to take
the whole stock from the farms of Kirkinhope,
belonging to David Bryden, who lived
at a distance, because it was proven,
that Mr Renwick had preached and baptized
some children on the bounds of that
farm. That stock he caused to be taken to
Selkirk, and sent orders to the sheriff to sell
it by public roup, at the cross, to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
bidder; but with Walter&#8217;s stock he did
not meddle at that time; so far did justice
mark his proceedings. He strongly suspected
him, and wished to have him convicted;
and certainly would have taken all
the family with him prisoners, had not the
curate&#8211;clerk arrived at that critical time.
Him Clavers consulted apart, and was soon
given to understand the steadfast loyalty of
the gudewife, daughter, and all the family,
save Walter, whom, he said, he suspected
of a secret connivance with the Cameronians.
This was merely to serve a selfish
purpose, for the clerk suspected no
such thing at that time. It had the desired
effect. Clavers set all the rest of the
family free, but took the good man with
him prisoner; put two of his best horses
in requisition; mounted himself on a diminutive
poney, with the thumbikins on
his hands, and his feet chained below
its belly. In this degrading situation, he
was put under the care of Serjeant Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Macpherson and five troopers; and Clavers,
with the rest of his company, hasted,
with great privacy and celerity, into that
inhospitable wild, which forms the boundary
between Drummelzier and the Johnstons
of Annandale. The greater part of
the fugitives had taken shelter there at that
time, it being the most inaccessible part in
the south of Scotland, and that where, of
all others, they had been the least troubled.
No troops could subsist near them; and all
that the military could do was to set watches
near every pass to and from these mountains,
where a few stragglers were killed,
but not many in proportion to the numbers
that had there sought a retreat.</p>

<p>The Covenanters knew that Clavers would
make a sweeping and exterminating circuit
about that time&#8212;incidents which were not
to be overlooked, had been paving the way
for it&#8212;incidents with which the main body
of that people were totally unconnected.
But it was usual at that time, and a very
unfair practice it was, that whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
said, or perpetrated, by any intemperate fanatical
individual, or any crazy wight, driven
half mad by ill usage&#8212;whatever was
said or done by such, was always attributed
to the whole sect as a body. It is too true
that the Privy Council chose, invariably,
men void of all feeling or remorse to lead
these troops. A man had nothing to study
but to be cruel enough to rise in the army
in those days; yet, because there was a
Dalziel, a Graham, a Creighton, and a
Bruce among the king&#8217;s troops, it would be
unfair to suppose all the rest as void of every
principle of feeling and forbearance as
they. In like manner, because some of
the Covenanters said violent and culpable
things, and did worse, it is hard to blame
the whole body for these; for, in the scattered
prowling way in which they were driven
to subsist, they had no controul over
individuals.</p>

<p>They had been looking for the soldiers&#8217;
appearing there for several days, and that
same morning had been on the watch; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the day was now so far advanced that they
were waxen remiss, and had retired to their
dens and hiding&#8211;places. Besides, he came
so suddenly upon them, that some parties,
as well as several stragglers, were instantly
discovered. A most determined pursuit ensued,
Clavers exerted himself that day in
such a manner, gallopping over precipices,
and cheering on his dragoons, that all the
country people who beheld him believed
him to be a devil, or at least mounted on
one. The marks of that infernal courser&#8217;s
feet are shewn to this day on a steep, nearly
perpendicular, below the Bubbly Craig,
along which he is said to have ridden at full
speed, in order to keep sight of a party of
the flying Covenanters. At another place,
called the Blue Sklidder, on the Merk side,
he had far outrode all his officers and dragoons
in the pursuit of five men, who fled
straggling athwart the steep. He had discharged
both his pistols without effect; and
just as he was making ready to cleave down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the hindmost with his sabre, he was attacked
by another party, who rolled huge stones
at him from the precipice above, and obliged
him to make a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Tradition has preserved the whole of his
route that day with the utmost minuteness.
It is not easy to account for this. These
minute traditions are generally founded on
truth; yet though two generations have
scarcely passed away since the date of this
tale,<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> tradition, in this instance, relates
things impossible, else Clavers must indeed
have been one of the infernals. Often has
the present relater of this tale stood over
the deep green marks of that courser&#8217;s
hoof, many of which remain on that hill,
in awe and astonishment, to think that he
was actually looking at the traces made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
by the devil&#8217;s foot, or at least by a horse
that once belonged to him.</p>

<p>Five men were slain that day; but as
they were all westland men, very little is
known concerning them. One of them was
shot at a distance by some dragoons who
were in pursuit of him, just as he was entering
a morass, where he would certainly
have escaped them. He is buried on a place
called the Watch Knowe, a little to the
south&#8211;east of Loch Skene, beside a cairn
where he had often sat keeping watch for
the approach of enemies, from which circumstance
the height derived its name.
When he fell, it being rough broken ground,
they turned and rode off without ever going
up to the body. Four were surprised
and taken prisoners on a height called Ker&#8211;Cleuch&#8211;Ridge,
who were brought to Clavers
and shortly examined on a little crook in
the Erne Cleuch, a little above the old
steading at Hopertoudy.</p>

<p>Macpherson kept the high road, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
it was, with his prisoner; but travelled no
faster than just to keep up with the parties
that were scouring the hills on each side;
and seeing these unfortunate men hunted in
from the hill, he rode up with his companions
and charge to see the issue, remarking
to Walter, that &#8220;he woolt not pe much
creat deal te worse of scheeing fwat te Cot
t&#8209;&#8209;n&#8217;d fwigs would pe getting.&#8221;</p>

<p>How did Walter&#8217;s heart smite him when
he saw that one of them was the sensible,
judicious, and honourable fellow with whom
he fought, and whose arm he had dislocated
by a blow with his stick! It was still
hanging in a sling made of a double rash
rope.</p>

<p>They would renounce nothing, confess
nothing, nor yield, in the slightest degree,
to the threats and insulting questions put
by the general. They expected no mercy,
and they cringed for none; but seemed all
the while to regard him with pity and contempt.
Walter often said that he was an
ill judge of the cause for which these men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
suffered; but whatever might be said of it,
they were heroes in that cause. Their complexions
were sallow, and bore marks of
famine and other privations; their beards
untrimmed; their apparel all in rags, and
their hats slouched down about their ears
with sleeping on the hills. All this they
had borne with resignation and without a
murmur; and, when brought to the last,
before the most remorseless of the human
race, they shewed no symptoms of flinching
or yielding up an item of the cause they had
espoused.</p>

<p>When asked &#8220;if they would pray for the
king?&#8221;</p>

<p>They answered, &#8220;that they would with
all their hearts;&#8212;they would pray for his
forgiveness, in time and place convenient,
but not when every profligate bade them,
which were a loathful scurrility, and a
mockery of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would they acknowledge him as their
right and lawful sovereign?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that they would never do! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was a bloody and designing papist, and had
usurped a prerogative that belonged not to
him. To acknowledge the Duke of York
for king, would be to acknowledge the divine
approbation of tyranny, oppression,
usurpation, and all that militates against
religion or liberty, as well as justifying the
abrogation of our ancient law relating to
the succession; and that, besides, he had
trampled on every civil and religious right,
and was no king for Scotland, or any land
where the inhabitants did not chuse the
most abject and degrading slavery. For
their parts, they would never acknowledge
him; and though it was but little that their
protestations and their blood could avail,
they gave them freely. They had but few
left to mourn for them, and these few might
never know of their fate; but there was <i>One</i>
who knew their hearts, who saw their sufferings,
and in Him they trusted that the
days of tyranny and oppression were wearing
to a close, and that a race yet to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
might acknowledge that they had not shed
their blood in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clavers ordered them all to be shot.
They craved time to pray, but he objected,
sullenly alleging, that he had not time
to spare. Mr Copland said,&#8212;&#8220;My lord,
you had better grant the poor wretches
that small indulgence.&#8221; On which Clavers
took out his watch, and said he would
grant them two minutes, provided they did
not howl. When the man with the hurt
arm turned round to kneel, Walter could
not help crying out to him in a voice half
stifled with agony&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! lak&#8211;a&#8211;day, man! is it come to this
with you, and that so soon? This is a sad
sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man pretended to put on a strange
and astonished look towards his benefactor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever you are,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that pities
the sufferings of a hapless stranger, I thank
you. May God requite you! but think of
yourself, and apply for mercy where it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
be found, for you are in the hands of those
whose boast it is to despise it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter at first thought this was strange,
but he soon perceived the policy of it, and
wondered at his friend&#8217;s readiness at such an
awful hour, when any acknowledgment of
connection would have been so fatal to himself.
They kneeled all down, clasped their
hands together, turned their faces to Heaven,
and prayed in a scarce audible whisper.
Captain Bruce, in the mean time, kneeled
behind the files, and prayed in mockery,
making a long face, wiping his eyes, and
speaking in such a ludicrous whine, that it
was impossible for the gravest face to retain
its muscles unaltered. He had more
to attend to him than the miserable sufferers.
When the two minutes were expired,
Clavers, who held his watch all the time,
made a sign to the dragoons who were
drawn up, without giving any intimation
to the sufferers, which, perhaps, was merciful,
and in a moment all the four were
launched into eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>The soldiers, for what reason Walter never
understood, stretched the bodies all in
a straight line on the brae, with their faces
upwards, and about a yard distant from
one another, and then rode off as fast as
they could to get another hunt, as they
called it. These four men were afterwards
carried by the fugitives, and some country
people, and decently interred in Ettrick
church&#8211;yard. Their graves are all in a row
a few paces from the south&#8211;west corner of
the present church. The goodman of Chapelhope,
some years thereafter, erected a
head&#8211;stone over the grave of the unfortunate
sufferer whose arm he had broken,
which, with its rude sculpture, is to be
seen to this day. His name was Walter
Biggar. A small heap of stones is raised
on the place where they were shot.</p>

<p>The last look which Walter took of the
four corpses, as they lay stretched on the
brae, with the blood streaming from them,
had nearly turned his brain. His heart
sunk within him. For years and days they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
never left his mind&#8217;s eye, sleeping nor waking.
He always thought he saw them
lying on the green sloping brae, with their
pale visages, blue open lips, clasped hands,
and dim stedfast eyes still fixed on the Heavens.
He had heard Clavers and his officers
called heroes: He wished those who
believed so had been there that day to have
judged who were the greatest heroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! let them take that!&#8221; said Captain
Bruce, as he mounted his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor misled unfortunate beings!&#8221; said
Copland, and mounted his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n!&#8221; said Roy Macpherson,
in a voice that seemed to struggle for
an outlet; and Walter, to his astonishment,
saw a tear glistening on his rough weather&#8211;beaten
cheek, as he turned to ride away!</p>

<p>The pursuit continued unabated for the
whole of that day. There was a great deal
of firing, but the hills of Polmoody were
inaccessible to cavalry. There was no more
blood shed. They lodged that night at a
place called Kippelgill, where they put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
every thing in requisition about the house,
and killed some of the cattle. Clavers was
in extremely bad humour, and Walter had
no doubt that he once intended to have sacrificed
him that night, but seemed to
change his mind, after having again examined
him. He was very stern, and threatened
him with the torture, swearing that he
knew him to be the supporter of that nest
of miscreants that harboured around him,
and that though he should keep him prisoner
for a dozen years, he would have it
proven on him. Walter made oath that
there had never one of them been within
his door, consistent with his knowledge;
that he had never been at a conventicle;
and proffered to take the test, and oath of
abjuration, if allowed to do so. All this
would not satisfy Clavers. Walter said he
wondered at his discernment, for, without
the least evil or disloyal intent, he found
he had rendered himself liable to punishment,
but how he could be aware of that
he knew not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Walter was confined in a cow&#8211;house,
under the same guard that had conducted
him from Chapelhope. The soldiers
put his arms round one of the stakes for the
cattle, and then screwed on the thumbikins,
so that he was fastened to the stake without
being much incommoded. When Macpherson
came in at a late hour, (for he was
obliged likewise to take up his abode in the
cow&#8211;house over night), the first word he
said was,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n, she no pe liking to schee an
honest shentleman tied up to a stake, as
she were peing a poollock.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then began to lecture Walter on the
magnitude of folly it would be in him to
run away, &#8220;when he took it into consideration
that he had a ponny fhamily, and
sheeps, and horses, and bheasts, that would
all pe maide acchountable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter acknowledged the force of his
reasoning; said it was sterling common
sense, and that nothing would induce him
to attempt such a dangerous experiment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
attempting to make his escape. Macpherson
then loosed him altogether, and conversed
with him until he fell asleep. Walter
asked him, what he thought of his case
with the general? Macpherson shook his
head. Walter said there was not the shadow
of a proof against him!</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Macpherson; &#8220;py cot&#8217;s curse
but there is! There is very much deal of
proof. Was not there my countrymen and
scholdiers murdered on your grhounds?
Was not there mhore scoans, and prochin,
and muttons in your house, than would
have peen eaten in a mhonth by the fhamily
that pelongs to yourself. By the pode
more of the auld deal, but there is more
proof than would hang twenty poor peheoples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s but sma&#8217; comfort, man! But
what think ye I should do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n, if I know!&#8212;Who is it that is
your Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief!&#8212;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&#8220;Tat is te head of te clan&#8212;Te pig man
of your name and fhamily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In troth, man, an&#8217; there isna ane o&#8217; my
name aboon mysel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fwat? Cot&#8217;s everlasting plissing! are
you te chief of te clan, M&#8217;Leadle? Then,
sir, you are a shentleman indeed. Though
your clan should pe never so poor, you are
a shentleman; and you must pe giving me
your hand; and you need not think any
shame to pe giving me your hand; for hersel
pe a shentleman pred and porn, and
furst coosin to Cluny Macpherson&#8217;s sister&#8211;in&#8211;law.
Who te deal dha more she pe this
clan, M&#8217;Leadle? She must be of Macleane.
She ance pe prhother to ourselves, but fell
into great dishunity by the preaking off of
Finlay Gorm More Machalabin Macleane
of Ilanterach and Ardnamurchan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter having thus set Daniel Roy Macpherson
on the top of his hobby&#8211;horse by
chance, there was no end of the matter!
He went on with genealogies of uncouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
names, and spoke of some old free&#8211;booters
as the greatest of all kings. Walter had no
means of stopping him, but by pretending
to fall asleep, and when Macpherson weened
that no one was listening farther to him,
he gave up the theme, turned himself over,
and uttered some fervent sentences in Gaelic,
with heavy moans between.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you are saying now,&#8221; said
Walter, pretending to rouse himself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pe sad works this,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Huh!
Cot in heaven aye! Hersel would be fighting
te Campbells, sword in hand, for every
inch of the Moor of Rhanoch; but Cot

through te podies of te poor helpless insignificant
crheatures. T&#8209;&#8209;n&#8217;d foolish ignorant
peheople! Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n, if she pe having
the good sense and prhudence of a bheast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter commended his feeling, and again
asked his advice with regard to his own
conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is te great man tat is te laird to
yourself?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8220;Mr Hay of Drumelzier,&#8221; was answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then lose not a mhoment in getting
his very good report or security. All goes
by that. It will do more ghood than any
stock of innocence; and you had need to
look very sharp, else he may soon cut you
short. It&#8217;s a very good and a very kind
man, but she pe caring no more for the
lives of peoples, tan I would do for as
many ptarmigans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter pondered on this hint throughout
the night; and the more he did so the more
he was convinced, that, as the affairs of the
country were then conducted, Macpherson&#8217;s
advice was of the first utility. He sent for
one of the shepherds of Kippelgill next
morning, charged him with an express to
his family, and unable to do any thing further
for himself, submitted patiently to his
fate.</p>

<p>Clavers having been informed that night
that some great conventicles had been held
to the southward, he arose early, crossed
the mountains by the Pennera Corse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
entered that district of the south called
Eskdale. He had run short of ammunition
by the way, and knowing of no other supply,
dispatched Bruce with 20 men by the
way of Ettrick, to plunder the aisle where
the ancient and noble family of the Scotts
of Thirlstane were enshrined in massy leaden
chests. From these he cut the lids, and
otherwise damaged them, scattering the
bones about in the aisle; but the Scotts of
Daventon shortly after gathered up the relics
of their ancestors, which they again deposited
in the chests,&#8212;closed them up with
wooden lids, and buried them deep under
the aisle floor, that they might no more be
discomposed by the hand of wanton depravity.</p>

<p>At a place called the Steps of Glenderg,
Clavers met with Sir James Johnston of
Westeraw, with fifty armed men, who gave
him an exaggerated account of the district
of Eskdale, telling him of such and such
field&#8211;meetings, and what inflammatory discourses
had there been delivered, insinuating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
all the while that the whole dale ought
to be made an example of. Clavers rejoiced
in his heart at this, for the works of
devastation and destruction were beginning
to wear short. The Covenanters were now
so sorely reduced, that scarcely durst one
show his face, unless it were to the moon
and stars of Heaven. A striking instance
of this I may here relate by the way, as it
happened on the very day to which my
tale has conducted me.</p>

<p>A poor wanderer, named, I think, Matthew
Douglas, had skulked about these
mountains, chiefly in a wild glen, called
the Caldron, ever since the battle of Bothwell&#8211;bridge.
He had made several narrow,
and, as he thought, most providential escapes,
but was at length quite overcome by
famine, cold, and watching; and finding
his end approaching, he crept by night into
a poor widow&#8217;s house at Kennelburn, whose
name, if my informer is not mistaken, was
Ann Hyslop. Ann was not a Cameronian,
but being of a gentle and humane disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
she received the dying man kindly&#8212;watched,
and even wept over him, administering
to all his wants. But the vital springs
of life were exhausted and dried up: He
died on the second day after his arrival,
and was buried with great privacy, by
night, in the church&#8211;yard at Westerkirk.</p>

<p>Sir James Johnston had been a zealous
Covenanter, and at first refused the test
with great indignation; but seeing the dangerous
ground on which he stood and that
his hand was on the lion&#8217;s mane, he renounced
these principles; and, to render his
apostacy effective, became for a time a most
violent distresser of his former friends. He
knew at this time that Clavers was coming
round; and in order to ingratiate himself
with him, he had for several days been raging
up and down the country like a roaring
lion, as they termed it. It came to his
ears what Ann Hyslop had done; whereon,
pretending great rage, he went with his
party to the burial ground, digged the
body out of the grave, and threw it over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
church&#8211;yard wall for beasts of prey to devour.
Forthwith he proceeded to Kennelburn&#8212;plundered
the house of Ann Hyslop, and
then burnt it to ashes; but herself he could
not find, for she had previously absconded.
Proceeding to the boundary of the county,
he met and welcomed Clavers to his assistance,
breathing nothing but revenge against
all non&#8211;conformists, and those of his own
district in particular.</p>

<p>Clavers knew mankind well. He perceived
the moving cause of all this, and did
not appear so forward and hearty in the
business as Sir James expected. He resolved
to ravage Eskdale, but to manage matters
so that the whole blame might fall on
Johnston. This he effected so completely,
that he made that knight to be detested
there as long as he lived, and his memory
to be abhorred after his decease. He found
him forward in the cause; and still the
more so that he appeared to be, the more
shy and backward was Clavers, appearing
to consent to every thing with reluctance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
They condemned the stocks of sheep on
Fingland and the Casways on very shallow
grounds. Clavers proposed to spare them;
but Sir James swore that they should not
be spared, that their owners might learn
the value of conventicles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Clavers, &#8220;since you
will have it so, let them be driven off.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this manner they proceeded down that
unhappy dale, and at Craikhaugh, by sheer
accident, lighted on Andrew Hyslop, son
to the widow of Kennelburn above&#8211;mentioned.
Johnston apprehended him, cursed,
threatened, and gnashed his teeth on him
with perfect rage. He was a beautiful youth,
only nineteen years of age. On his examination,
it appeared that he had not been at
home, nor had any hand in sheltering the
deceased; but he knew, he said, that his
mother had done so, and in doing it, had
done well; and he was satisfied that act of
her&#8217;s would be approven of in the eye of
the Almighty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>Clavers asked, &#8220;Have you ever attended
the field conventicles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever preached yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that you could preach?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I could not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be d&#8209;&#8209;d but you can pray then,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>He then proffered him his liberty if he
would confess that his mother had done
wrong, but this he would in no wise do;
for, he said, it would be a sinful and shameful
lie, he being convinced that his mother
had done what was her duty, and the duty
of every Christian to do towards his fellow&#8211;creatures.</p>

<p>Johnston swore he should be shot. Clavers
hesitated, and made some objections; but
the other persisting, as Clavers knew he
would, the latter consented, as formerly,
saying, &#8220;Well, well, since you will have it
so, let it be done&#8212;his blood be on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
head, I am free of it.&#8212;Daniel Roy Macpherson,
draw up your file, and put the sentence
in execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyslop kneeled down. They bade him
put on his bonnet, and draw it over his
eyes; but this he calmly refused, saying,
&#8220;He had done nothing of which he was
ashamed, and could look on his murderers
and to Heaven without dismay.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Macpherson heard this, and looked
at him as he kneeled on the ground with
his hands pinioned, his beautiful young face
turned toward the sky, and his long fair
ringlets hanging waving backward, his heart
melted within him, and the great tears
had for sometime been hopping down his
cheeks. When Clavers gave the word of
command to shoot the youth, Macpherson
drew up his men in a moment&#8212;wheeled
them off at the side&#8212;presented arms&#8212;and
then answered the order of the general as
follows, in a voice that was quite choaked
one while, and came forth in great vollies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
at another&#8212;&#8220;Now, Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n&#8212;sh&#8212;sh&#8212;she&#8217;ll
rather pe fighting Clavers and all her
draghoons, pe&#8212;pe&#8212;pefore she&#8217;ll pe killing
tat dear good lhad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Bruce burst out into a horse&#8211;laugh,
leaping and clapping his hands on
hearing such a singular reply; even Clavers
had much ado to suppress a smile, which,
however, he effected by uttering a horrible
curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgot, Sir James,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;Macpherson is as brave a man as ever
strode on a field of battle; but in domestic
concerns, he has the heart of a chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then ordered four of his own guards
to shoot him, which they executed in a moment.
Some of his acquaintances being present,
they requested permission of Clavers
to bury him, which he readily granted, and
he was interred on the very spot where he
fell. A grave stone was afterwards erected
over him, which is still to be seen at Craikhaugh,
near the side of the road, a little to
the north of the Church of Eskdale&#8211;muir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>Clavers and his prisoner lodged at Westeraw
that night. Johnston wanted to have
him shot; but to this Clavers objected,
though rather in a jocular manner.</p>

<p>Walter said, he was sure if Sir James had
repeated his request another time, that Clavers&#8217;
answer would have been, &#8220;Well, well,
since you will have it so,&#8221; &amp;c.; but, fortunately
for Walter, he desisted just in
time.</p>

<p>These two redoubted champions continued
their progress all next day; and on
the third, at evening, Clavers crossed Dryfe,
with nine thousand sheep, three hundred
goats, and about as many cattle and horses,
in his train, taken from the people of Eskdale
alone. He took care to herry Sir
James&#8217;s tenants, in particular, of every
thing they possessed, and apparently all
by their laird&#8217;s desire, so that very little of
the blame attached to the general. He
was heard to say to Sir Thomas Livingston
that night, &#8220;I trow, we hae left the
silly turn&#8211;coat a pirn to wind.&#8221;&#8212;But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
must now leave them to continue their
route of rapine and devastation, and return
to the distressed family of Chapelhope, in
order that we may watch the doings of the
Brownie of Bodsbeck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>For all Maron Linton&#8217;s grievous distresses,
the arrival of Clerk, the curate,
proved an antidote of no small avail. It
was a great comfort to her, in the midst of
her afflictions; and after she had been assured
by him of Walter&#8217;s perfect safety, she
became apparently more happy, and certainly
more loquacious, than she had been
for a great while byegone. She disclosed
to him the dreadful secret, that her child
was possessed of an evil spirit, and implored
his influence with Heaven, and his
power with hell, for its removal. This he
readily undertook, on condition of being
locked up with the maiden for a night, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
two at most. She was to be left solely to
his management; without the interference
of any other human being; and with the
help only of the Bible, the lamp, and the
hour&#8211;glass, he declared that he would drive
the unclean spirit from his tabernacle of
clay.</p>

<p>To these conditions Maron Linton gladly
assented; and, with grateful and fond acknowledgments,
called him their benefactor
and spiritual guide, their deliverer and
shield; but he checked her, and said, there
was still one condition more on which she
behoved to condescend. It was likely that
he might be under the hard necessity of
using some violent measures in exorcising
her, for it would be hard to drive the malignant
spirit from so sweet a habitation; but
whatever noises might be heard, no one was
to interfere, or even listen, upon pain of
being delivered up to the foul spirit, soul
and body; and it was ten to one that any
who was so imprudent as to intrude on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
awful and mysterious rites, might be torn
in pieces.</p>

<p>Maron blest herself from all interference,
and gave Nanny directions to the same
purport; as for the two boys, they slept
out of hearing. She likewise gave him the
key, that he might lock both the doors of
the Old Room in the inside, and thus prevent
all intrusions, should any be offered.
He said prayers in the family, to which
Katharine was admitted; and then taking
the lamp and the hour&#8211;glass in his hand,
and the Bible below his arm, he departed
into the Old Room, where, in about half an
hour afterwards, the maiden was summoned
to attend him. He took her respectfully
by the hand, and seated her on a chair at
the side of the bed, saying, that he was
commissioned by her worthy mother to
hold a little private conversation with her.
Then locking the door, and putting the
key in his pocket, he added, &#8220;You are my
prisoner for this night, but be not alarmed;
I have undertaken to drive an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
spirit away from you, but both my exorcisms
and orisons shall be adapted to the
feelings of a young maiden, and as agreeable
to one whom I so much admire, as it
is in my power to make them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katharine grew as pale as death as he
uttered these words, and placed himself
cordially by her side.</p>

<p>It is unmeet to relate the conversation
that ensued; but the worthy curate soon
showed off in his true colours, and with unblushing
front ventured a proposal that
shocked the innocent and modest Katharine
so much, that she could only reply to
it by holding up her hands, and uttering a
loud exclamation of astonishment. His
further precedure soon convinced her, that
she was in the hands of a man who was determined
to take every advantage of the
opportunity thus unwarrantably afforded
him, and to stick at no atrocity for the accomplishment
of his purposes.</p>

<p>She neither descended to tears nor entreaties,
but resisted all his approaches with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a firmness and dignity that he never conceived
to have formed any part of her character;
and, when continuing to press her
hand, she said to him, &#8220;You had better
keep your distance, Mass John Clerk, and
consider what befits your character, and
the confidence reposed in you by my unsuspecting
parent; but I tell you, if you again
presume to touch me, though it were but
with one of your fingers, I will, in a moment,
bring those out of the chink of the
wall, or from under that hearth, that shall
lay you motionless at my feet in the twinkling
of an eye, or bear you off to any part
of the creation that I shall name.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled as she said this, and was about
to turn it into a jest; but on looking at
her face, he perceived that there was not
one trait of jocularity in it. It beamed with
a mystical serenity which sent a chillness
through his whole frame; and, for the first
time, he deemed her deranged, or possessed
in some manner, he wist not how.
Staunch, however, to his honourable purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
he became so unequivocal, that she
was obliged to devise some means of attaining
a temporary cessation; and feigning to
hesitate on his proposal, she requested a
minute or two to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am but young, Mass John,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;and have no experience in the ways of
the world; and it seems, from what you
have advanced, that I attach more importance
to some matters than they deserve.
But I beg of you to give me a little time
to reflect on the proposal you have made.
See that hour&#8211;glass is half run out already:
I only ask of you not to disturb or importune
me until it run out a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you then promise to do as I
request?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; returned she, &#8220;provided you
still continue of the same mind as you are
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind is made up,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and
my resolution taken in all that relates to
you; nevertheless, it would be hard to refuse
a maid so gentle and modest a request&#8212;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
grant it&#8212;and should you attempt to
break off your engagement at the expiry of
the time, it shall be the worse for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be it so,&#8221; replied she; &#8220;in the meantime
let me be undisturbed till then.&#8221; And
so saying, she arose and went aside to the
little table where the Bible and the lamp
were placed, and began with great seriousness
to search out, and peruse parts of the
sacred volume.</p>

<p>Clerk liked not this contemplative mood,
and tried every wile in his power to draw
her attention from the Scriptures. He sought
out parts which he desired her to read, if
she would read; but from these she turned
away without deigning to regard them, and
gently reminded him that he had broken
one of his conditions. &#8220;Maids only impose
such conditions on men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;as
they desire should be broken.&#8221; At this
she regarded him with a look of ineffable
contempt, and continued to read on in her
Bible.</p>

<p>The hour of midnight was now passed,&#8212;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sand had nearly run out for the second
time since the delay had been acceded to,
and Clerk had been for a while tapping the
glass on the side, and shaking it, to make
it empty its contents the sooner. Katharine
likewise began to eye it with looks that
manifested some degree of perturbation;
she clasped the Bible, and sate still in one
position, as if listening attentively for some
sound or signal. The worthy curate at
length held the hour&#8211;glass up between her
eye and the burning lamp,&#8212;the last lingering
pile of sand fell reluctantly out as he
shook it in that position,&#8212;anxiety and suspense
settled more deeply on the lovely
and serene face of Katharine; but instead
of a flexible timidity, it assumed an air of
sternness. At that instant the cock crew,&#8212;she
started,&#8212;heaved a deep sigh, like one
that feels a sudden relief from pain, and a
beam of joy shed its radiance over her
countenance. Clerk was astonished,&#8212;he
could not divine the source or cause of her
emotions, but judging from his own corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
heart, he judged amiss. True however to
his point, he reminded her of her promise,
and claimed its fulfilment. She deigned
no reply to his threats or promises, but kept
her eye steadfastly fixed on another part of
the room. He bade her remember that he
was not to be mocked, and in spite of her
exertions, he lifted her up in his arms, and
carried her across the room towards the
bed. She uttered a loud scream, and in a
moment the outer&#8211;door that entered from
the bank was opened, and a being of such
unearthly dimensions entered, as you may
never wholly define. It was the Brownie
of Bodsbeck, sometimes mentioned before,
small of stature, and its whole form utterly
mis&#8211;shaped. Its beard was long and grey,
while its look, and every lineament of its
face, were indicative of agony&#8212;its locks
were thin, dishevelled, and white, and its
back hunched up behind its head. There
seemed to be more of the same species
of hagard beings lingering behind at the
door, but this alone advanced with a slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
majestic pace. Mass John uttered two involuntary
cries, somewhat resembling the
shrill bellowings of an angry bull, mixed
with inarticulate rumblings,&#8212;sunk powerless
on the floor, and, with a deep shivering
groan, fainted away. Katharine,
stretching forth her hands, flew to meet
her unearthly guardian;&#8212;&#8220;Welcome, my
watchful and redoubted Brownie,&#8221; said
she; &#8220;thou art well worthy to be familiar
with an empress, rather than an insignificant
country maiden.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Brownie&#8217;s here, Brownie&#8217;s there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brownie&#8217;s with thee every where,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>said the dwarfish spirit, and led her off in
triumph.</p>

<p>Having bethought herself after she went
out, she returned lightly, took the keys
from the pocket of the forlorn priest, extinguished
the lamp, and again disappeared,
locking the door on the outside.</p>

<p>Mass John&#8217;s trance threw him into a
heavy and perturbed slumber, which overpowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
him for a long space; and even
after he awaked, it was long before he could
fathom the circumstances of his case, for
he imagined he had only been in a frightful
and oppressive dream; till, beginning
to grope about, he discovered that he was
lying on the damp floor with his clothes on;
and at length, without opening his eyes, he
recovered by degrees his reasoning faculties,
and was able to retrace the circumstances
that led to his present situation.
He arose in great dismay&#8212;the day&#8211;light had
begun to shine into the room, and finding
that both doors were locked, he deemed it
unadvisable to make any noise, and threw
himself upon the bed. The retrospect of
his adventure was fraught with shame and
astonishment. He had acted a considerable
part in it, but he had dreamed of a great
deal more, and with all his ingenuity he
could not separate in his mind the real incidents
from those that were imaginary.
He arose with the sun, and rapped gently
at the inner&#8211;door, which, to his still farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
astonishment, was opened by Katharine, in
her usual neat and cleanly morning dress.
He stared in her face, to mark if he could
read any meaning in it&#8212;he could distinguish
none that spoke a language to him
either good or bad&#8212;it was a face of calm
decent serenity, and wore no shade of either
shame or anger&#8212;somewhat paler than
it was the evening before, but still as lovely
as ever. The curate seemed gasping for
breath, but not having courage to address
her, he walked forth to the open air.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning in September;
the ground was covered with a slight
hoar frost, and a cloud of light haze (or
as the country people call it, <i>the blue ouder</i>,)
slept upon the long valley of water,
and reached nearly midway up the hills.
The morning sun shone full upon it, making
it appear like an ocean of silvery
down. It vanished by imperceptible degrees
into the clear blue firmament, and
was succeeded by a warm sun and a southerly
breeze. It was such a morning as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
could not fail to cheer and re&#8211;animate
every heart and frame, not wholly overcome
by guilt and disease&#8212;Clark&#8217;s were
neither&#8212;he was depraved of heart, but insensible
to the evil of such a disposition;
he had, moreover, been a hanger&#8211;on from
his youth upward, and had an effrontery
not to be outfaced. Of course, by the time
he had finished a three&#8211;hour&#8217;s walk, he felt
himself so much refreshed and invigorated
in mind, that he resolved not to expose
himself to the goodwife, who was his principal
stay and support among his straggled
and dissatisfied flock, by a confession of the
dreadful fright he had gotten, but to weather
out the storm with as lofty and saintly
a deportment as he could.</p>

<p>He had not well gone out when the lad
of Kepplegill arrived, and delivered to Katharine
her father&#8217;s letter. She saw the
propriety of the injunction which it bore,
and that an immediate application to their
laird, Drumelzier, who was then high in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
trust and favour with the party in power,
was the likeliest of all ways to procure her
father&#8217;s relief, neither durst she trust the
mission to any but herself. But ah! there
was a concealed weight that pressed upon
her spirit&#8212;a secret circumstance that compelled
her to stay at home, and which could
not be revealed to mortal ear. Her father&#8217;s
fate was at present uncertain and ticklish,
but that secret once revealed, tortures,
death, and ruin were inevitable&#8212;the doom
of the whole family was sealed. She knew
not what to do, for she had none to advise
with. There was but one on earth to whom
this secret could be imparted; indeed there
was but one in whose power it was to execute
the trust which the circumstances of
the case required, and that was old Nanny,
who was crazed, fearless, and altogether inscrutable.
Another trial, however, of her religious
principles, and adherence to the established
rules of church government in the
country, was absolutely necessary; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that trial our young and mysterious heroine
went with all possible haste, as well as precaution.</p>

<p>Whosoever readeth this must paint to
themselves old Nanny, and they must paint
her aright, with her thin fantastic form and
antiquated dress, bustling up and down the
house. Her fine stock of bannocks had
been all exhausted&#8212;the troopers and their
horses had left nothing in her master&#8217;s house
that could either be eaten or conveniently
carried away. She had been early astir, as
well as her sedate and thoughtful young
dame, had been busy all the morning, and
the whole time her tongue never at rest.
She had been singing one while, speaking
to herself another, and every now and then
intermixing bitter reflections on Clavers and
his troops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wae be to them for a pack o&#8217; greedy
gallayniels&#8212;they haena the mence of a miller&#8217;s
yaud; for though she&#8217;ll stap her nose
into every body&#8217;s pock, yet when she&#8217;s fou
she&#8217;ll carry naething wi&#8217; her. Heichow!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
wae&#8217;s me, that I sude hae lived to see the
day! That ever I sude hae lived to see the
colehood take the laverock&#8217;s place; and the
stanchel and the merlin chatterin&#8217; frae the
cushat&#8217;s nest! Ah! wae&#8217;s me! will the
sweet voice o&#8217; the turtle&#8211;doo be nae mair
heard in our land! There was a time when
I sat on the bonny green brae an&#8217; listened
to it till the tears dreepit frae my een, an&#8217;
a&#8217; the hairs o&#8217; my head stood on end!&#8212;The
hairs o&#8217; my head?&#8212;Ay, that&#8217;s nae lie!
They&#8217;re grey now, an&#8217; will soon be snaw&#8211;white
if heart&#8217;s care can alter them; but
they will never be sae white as they anes
war. I saw the siller&#8211;grey lock o&#8217; age, an&#8217;
the manly curls o&#8217; youth wavin&#8217; at my side
that day!&#8212;But where are they now? A&#8217;
mouled! a&#8217; mouled!&#8212;But the druckit
blood winna let them rot! I&#8217;ll see them rise
fresh an&#8217; bonny! I&#8217;ll look round to my right
hand and ane will sae, &#8216;Mother! my dear
mother, are you here with us?&#8217; I&#8217;ll turn to
my left hand, another will say, &#8216;Nanny!
my dear and faithful wife, are you too here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
with us?&#8217;&#8212;I&#8217;ll say, &#8216;Ay, John, I&#8217;m here;
I was yours in life; I have been yours in
death; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be yours in life again.&#8217;&#8212;Dear
bairn, dear bairn, are you there,&#8221; continued
she, observing Katharine standing
close behind her; &#8220;what was I saying, or
where was I at? I little wat outher what I
was saying or doing.&#8212;Hout ay; I was
gaun ower some auld things, but they&#8217;re a&#8217;
like a dream, an&#8217; when I get amang them
I&#8217;m hardly mysel. Dear bairn, ye maunna
mind an auld crazy body&#8217;s reveries.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was some need for this apology, if
Nanny&#8217;s frame, air, and attitude, are taken
into account. She was standing with her
back to the light, mixing meal with water,
whereof to make bread&#8212;her mutch, or
<i>night&#8211;hussing</i>, as she called it, was tied close
down over her cheeks and brow as usual;
her grey locks hanging dishevelled from
under it; and as she uttered the last sentence,
immediately before noticing her
young mistress, her thin mealy hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
stretched upwards, her head and body bent
back, and her voice like one in a paroxysm.
Katharine quaked, although well accustomed
to scenes of no ordinary nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; said she, &#8220;there is something
that preys upon your mind&#8212;some great
calamity that recurs to your memory, and
goes near to unhinge your tranquillity of
mind, if not your reason. Will you inform
me of it, good Nanny, that I may talk
and sympathize with you over it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear bairn, nae loss ava&#8212;A&#8217; profit! a&#8217;
profit i&#8217;the main! I haena biggit a bield o&#8217;
the windlestrae, nor lippened my weight
to a broken reed! Na, na, dear bairn; nae
loss ava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Nanny, I have overheard you in
your most secret hours, in your prayers and
self&#8211;examinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of this Nanny turned
about, and after a wild searching stare in
her young mistress&#8217;s face, while every nerve
of her frame seemed to shrink from the recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of the disclosures she feared she
had made, she answered as follows, in a
deep and tremulous tone:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was atween God and me&#8212;There
was neither language nor sound there for
the ear o&#8217; flesh!&#8212;It was unfair!&#8212;It was
unfair!&#8212;Ye are mistress here, and ye keep
the keys o&#8217; the aumbry, the kitchen, the
ha&#8217;, an&#8217; the hale house; but wi&#8217; the secret
keys o&#8217; the heart and conscience ye hae
naething to do!&#8212;the keys o&#8217; the sma&#8217;est
portal that leads to heaven or hell are nane
o&#8217; yours; therefore, what ye hae done was
unfair. If I chose, sinful and miserable as
I am, to converse with my God about the
dead as if they war living, an&#8217; of the living
as if they war dead, what&#8217;s that to you?
Or if I likit to take counsel of that which
exists only in my own mind, is the rackle
hand o&#8217; steelrife power to make a handle o&#8217;
that to grind the very hearts of the just and
the good, or turn the poor wasted frame o&#8217;
eild and resignation on the wheel?&#8212;Lack&#8211;a&#8211;day,
my dear bairn, I&#8217;m lost again! Ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
canna an&#8217; ye maunna forgie me now. Walth&#8217;s
dear, an&#8217; life&#8217;s dearer&#8212;but sin&#8217; it maun be
sae, twal o&#8217;clock sanna find me aneath your

but I maun tell ye ere I gae that ye&#8217;re i&#8217;the

ye, and O, it is a pity that a dear sweet
soul should be lost for want o&#8217; light to direct!
How can a dear bairn find the right
way wi&#8217; its een tied up? But I maun haud
my tongue an&#8217; leave ye&#8212;I wad fain greet,
but I hae lost the gate o&#8217;t, for the fountain&#8211;head

<p>This Nanny sung to an air so soothing,
and at the same time so melancholy, it was
impossible to listen to her unaffected, especially
as she herself was peculiarly so&#8212;a
beam of wild delight glanced in her eye,
but it was like the joy of grief, (if one may
be allowed the expression,) if not actually
the joy of madness. Nothing could be
more interesting than her character was
now to the bewildered Katharine&#8212;it arose
to her eyes, and grew on her mind like a
vision. She had been led previously to regard
her as having been crazed from her
birth, and her songs and chaunts to be
mere ravings of fancy, strung in rhymes to
suit favourite airs, or old scraps of ballads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
void of meaning, that she had learned in
her youth. But there was a wild elegance
at times in her manner of thinking and expression&#8212;a
dash of sublimity that was inconsistent
with such an idea. &#8220;Is it possible,&#8221;
(thus reasoned the maiden with herself,)
&#8220;that this demeanour can be the effect
of great worldly trouble and loss?&#8212;Perhaps
she is bereft of all those who were
near and dear to her in life&#8212;is left alone
as it were in this world, and has lost a relish
for all its concerns, while her whole
hope, heart, and mind, is fixed on a home
above, to which all her thoughts, dreams,
and even her ravings insensibly turn, and
to which the very songs and chaunts of her
youthful days are modelled anew. If such
is really her case, how I could sympathize
with her in all her feelings!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; said she, &#8220;how wofully you
misapprehend me; I came to exchange
burdens of heart and conscience with you&#8212;to
confide in you, and love you: Why
will not you do the same with me, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
me what loss it is that you seem to bewail
night and day, and what affecting theme it
is that thus puts you beside yourself?&#8212;If
I judge not far amiss, the knowledge of this
is of greater import to my peace than aught
in the world beside, and will lead to a secret
from me that deeply concerns us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny&#8217;s suspicions were aroused, not
laid, by this speech; she eyed her young
mistress steadfastly for a while, smiled, and
shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sae young, sae bonny, and yet sae cunning!&#8221;
said she. &#8220;Judas coudna hae sic
a face, but he had nouther a fairer tongue
nor a fauser heart!&#8212;A secret frae you,
dear bairn! what secret can come frae you,
but some bit waefu&#8217; love story, enough to
mak the pinks an&#8217; the ewe gowans blush to
the very lip? My heart&#8217;s wae for ye, ae
way an&#8217; a&#8217; ways; but its a part of your
curse&#8212;woman sinned an&#8217; woman maun suffer&#8212;her
hale life is but a succession o&#8217;
shame, degradation, and suffering, frae her
cradle till her grave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>Katharine was dumb for a space, for reasoning
with Nanny was out of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may one day rue this misprision of
my motives, Nanny,&#8221; rejoined she; &#8220;in the
mean time, I am obliged to leave home, on
an express that concerns my father&#8217;s life
and fortune; be careful of my mother until
my return, and of every thing about the
house, for the charge of all must devolve
for a space on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will, dear bairn&#8212;the thing that
Nanny has ta&#8217;en in hand sanna be neglected,
if her twa hands can do it, and her auld
crazed head comprehend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, first, tell me, and tell me seriously,
Nanny, are you subject to any apprehension
or terror on account of spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nae mair feared for them than I am
for you, an&#8217; no half sae muckle, wi&#8217; your
leave.&#8212;Spirits, quoth I!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little misters it to me<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Ah! noble Cleland! it is like his wayward
freaks an&#8217; whimsies! Did ye never
hear it, you that speaks about spirits as
they war your door neighbours? It&#8217;s a clever
thing; his sister sung it; I think, it
rins this gate&#8212;hum! but then the dilogue
comes in, and it is sae kamshachle I canna
word it, though I canna say it&#8217;s misleared
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Nanny, that is far from my question.
You say you are nothing afraid of
spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why should I? If they be good
spirits, they will do me nae ill; and if they
be evil spirits, they hae nae power here.
Thinkna ye that He that takes care o&#8217; me
throughout the day, is as able to do it by
night? Na, na, dear bairn, I hae contendit
wi&#8217; the warst o&#8217; a&#8217; spirits face to face, hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to hand, and breast to breast; ay, an&#8217; for
a&#8217; his power, an&#8217; a&#8217; his might, I dang him;
and packed him off baffled and shamed!&#8212;Little
reason hae I to be feared for ony o&#8217;
his black emissaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should one appear to you bodily, would
you be nothing distracted or frightened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my own strength I could not stand
it, but yet I would stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives me joy&#8212;Then, Nanny, list
to me: You will assuredly see one in my
absence; and you must take good heed to
my directions, and act precisely as I bid
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny gave up her work, and listened in
suspense. &#8220;Then it is a&#8217; true that the fock
says!&#8221; said she, with a long&#8211;drawn sigh.
&#8220;His presence be about us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sensibly you spoke just now!
Where is your faith fled already? I tell
you there will one appear to you every
night in my absence, precisely on the first
crowing of the cock, about an hour after
midnight, and you must give him every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
thing that he asks, else it may fare the
worse with you, and all about the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny&#8217;s limbs were unable to support
her weight&#8212;they trembled under her. She
sat down on a form, leaned her brow upon
both hands, and recited the 63d Psalm from
beginning to end in a fervent tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasna prepared for this,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I fear, though my faith may stand it, my
wits will not. Dear, dear bairn, is there
nae way to get aff frae sic a trial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one, which is fraught
with danger of another sort; but were I
sure that I could trust you with it, all
might be well, and you would rest free
from any intercourse with that unearthly
visitant, of whom it seems you are so much
in terror.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For my own sake ye may trust me
there: Ony thing but a bogle face to face
at midnight, an&#8217; me a&#8217; my lane. It is right
wonderfu&#8217;, though I ken I&#8217;ll soon be in a
warld o&#8217; spirits, an&#8217; that I maun mingle an&#8217;
mool wi&#8217; them for ages, how the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
within me revolts at a&#8217; communion wi&#8217; them
here. Dear bairn, gie me your other plan,
an&#8217; trust me for my own sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this&#8212;but if you adopt it, for your
life an&#8217; soul let no one in this place know
of it but yourself:&#8212;It is to admit one or
two of the fugitive whigs,&#8212;these people
that skulk and pray about the mountains,
privily into the house every night, until
my return. If you will give me any test
of your secrecy and truth, I will find ways
and means of bringing them to you, which
will effectually bar all intrusion of bogle or
Brownie on your quiet; or should any such
dare to appear, they will deal with it themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; <i>can</i> the presence o&#8217; ane o&#8217; <i>them</i> do
this?&#8221; said Nanny, starting up and speaking
in a loud eldrich voice. &#8220;Then Heaven
and hell acknowledges it, an&#8217; the earth
maun soon do the same! I knew it!&#8212;I
knew it!&#8212;I knew it!&#8212;ha, ha, ha, I knew
it!&#8212;Ah! John, thou art safe!&#8212;Ay! an&#8217;
mae than thee; an&#8217; there will be mae yet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
It is but a day! an&#8217; dark an&#8217; dismal though
it be, the change will be the sweeter!
Blessed, blessed be the day! None can say
of thee that thou died like a fool, for thy
hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into
fetters.&#8221; Then turning close round to
Katharine, with an expression of countenance
quite indescribable, she added in a
quick maddened manner,&#8212;&#8220;Eh? Thou
seekest a test of me, dost thou? Can blood
do it?&#8212;Can martyrdom do it?&#8212;Can bonds,
wounds, tortures, and mockery do it?&#8212;Can
death itself do it? All these have I
suffered for that cause <i>in this same body</i>;
mark that; for there is but one half of my
bone and my flesh here. But words are nothing
to the misbelieving&#8212;mere air mouthed
into a sound. Look at this for a test of
<i>my</i> sincerity and truth.&#8221; So saying, she
gave her hand a wild brandish in the air,
darted it at her throat, and snapping the
tie of her cap that she had always worn
over her face, she snatched it off, and turning
her cheek round to her young mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
added, &#8220;Look there for your test, and if
that is not enough, I will give you more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Katharine was struck dumb with astonishment
and horror. She saw that her ears
were cut out close to the skull, and a C. R.
indented on her cheek with a hot iron, as
deep as the jaw&#8211;bone. She burst out a
crying&#8212;clasped the old enthusiast in her
arms&#8212;kissed the wound and steeped it with
her tears, and without one further remark,
led her away to the Old Room, that they
might converse without interruption.</p>

<p>The sequel of this disclosure turned not
out as desired; but this we must leave by
the way, until we overtake it in the regular
course of the narrative.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>As soon as her father&#8217;s letter was put into
her hands, Katharine sent off one of her
brothers to Muchrah, to warn old John
and his son to come instantly to Chapelhope.
They both arrived while she and
Nanny were consulting in the Old Room.
She told them of her father&#8217;s letter, of the
jeopardy he was in, and of her intended
application to Drummelzier without loss of
time. &#8220;One of you,&#8221; said she, &#8220;must accompany
me; and I sent for you both, to
learn which could, with least inconvenience,
be wanted from your flocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for me,&#8221; said John, &#8220;it&#8217;s out o&#8217; the
question to <i>think</i> about me winning away.
The ewes wad gang wi&#8217; the bit hog&#8211;fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
o&#8217; the Quave Brae, stoup and roup. What
wi&#8217; ghaists, brownies, dead men, an&#8217; ae mischief
an&#8217; other, it is maistly gane already;
an&#8217; what&#8217;s to come o&#8217; the poor bits o&#8217; plottin
baggits a&#8217; winter, is mair nor I can tell.
They may pike the woo aff ane another for
aught that I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katharine was grieved to hear this remonstrance,
for she was desirous of having old
John as a guide and protector, who well
knew the way, and was besides singular for
strength and courage, if kept among beings
of this world. She represented to him that
the hog&#8211;fence of the Quave&#8211;Brae, could not
possibly be of equal importance with his
master&#8217;s life, nor yet with the loss of his
whole stock, both of sheep and cattle, which
might be confiscated, if prompt measures
were not adopted. Nothing, however,
could persuade John, that ought could be
of equal importance to him with that which
he had the charge of, and on which his heart
and attention were so much set both by
day and night. He said he had lost his lugs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and been brunt wi&#8217; the king&#8217;s birn, for the
hog&#8211;fence of the Quave&#8211;Brae; and when
he coudna get away to the prison at Edinburgh
for fear o&#8217;t, but suffered sae muckle
in place o&#8217; that, how could he win away a&#8217;
the gate to Dunse Castle?</p>

<p>Jasper liked not the journey more than
he; for being convinced of Katharine&#8217;s
power over spirits, he was very jealous of
her taking undue advantages of him, but he
was obliged to submit. He refused a horse,
saying &#8220;it would only taigle him, but if she
suffered him to gang on his feet, if he was
hindmost at Dunse, he should gie her leave
to cut the lugs out o&#8217; his head too, and then
he wad hae the thief&#8217;s mark on him like his
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away they went; she riding on a stout
shaggy poney, and Jasper running before
her barefoot, but with his <i>hose and shoon</i>
bound over his shoulder. He took the
straight line for Dunse, over hill and dale,
as a shepherd always does, who hates the
<i>wimples</i>, as he calls them, of a turnpike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
He took such a line as an eagle would take,
or a flock of wild geese journeying from the
one side of the country to the other, never
once reflecting on the inconvenience of riding
on such a road. Of course, it was impossible
his young mistress could keep up
with him&#8212;indeed she had often enough to
do in keeping sight of him. They met with
some curious adventures by the way, particularly
one near Thirlestane castle on Leader,
with some stragglers of a troop of soldiers.
But these things we must hurry
over as extraneous matter, having nothing
more to do with them than as connected
with the thread of our tale. They slept
that night at a farm&#8211;house in Lammermoor,
which belonged to Drummelzier, and next
day by noon arrived at Dunse Castle.</p>

<p>Drummelzier, being one of the Committee
of Public Safety, was absent from home, to
which he did not return for several days,
to the great perplexity of Katharine, who
was in the utmost distress about her father,
as well as her affairs at home. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
obliged, however, to wait with patience, as
no one knew in what part of the country
he was. The housekeeper, who was an
Englishwoman, was kind to her, and bade
her not be afraid, for that their master had
much more power with the government
than Claverhouse, the one being a moving
spring, and the other only a tool.</p>

<p>Drummelzier was a bold and determined
royalist&#8212;was, indeed, in high trust with
the Privy&#8211;council, and had it in his power
to have harassed the country as much, and
more, than the greater part of those who
did so; but, fortunately for that south&#8211;east
division of Scotland, he was a gentleman of
high honour, benevolence, and suavity of
manners, and detested any act of injustice
or oppression. He by these means contributed
materially to the keeping of a large
division of Scotland (though as whiggishly
inclined as any part of it, Ayrshire perhaps
excepted,) in perfect peace. The
very first dash that Clavers made among
the Covenanters, while he was as yet only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a captain of a company, was into this division
of the country over which Drummelzier
was appointed to keep an eye, and it
was in consequence of his intrepid and decided
behaviour there, that the Duke of
York interested himself in his behalf, and
procured him the command of a troop of
horse. At a place called Bewly, on the
confines of Roxburghshire, he surprised a
large conventicle about eleven o&#8217;clock on a
Sabbath morning. Having but a small band,
as soon as he appeared a crowd of the
hearers gathered round the preacher to defend
him, or to further his escape. Clavers
burst in upon them like a torrent; killed
and wounded upwards of an hundred; took
the preacher prisoner, and all such of the
hearers as were the most respectable in appearance.
He would have detained many
more had his force been sufficient for his designs,
for that very day, about five o&#8217;clock in
the afternoon, he surprised another numerous
conventicle, at a place called Helmburn&#8211;Linn,
in Selkirkshire, where he acted over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the same scene that he had done in the
morning. The people, it is true, did not
get time to rally round their pastor as at
the former place, for the first intelligence
they had of his approach was from a volley
of musketry among them from the top of
the linn, which took too sure effect.</p>

<p>The congregation scattered in a moment;
and as there were strong fastnesses near at
hand, none were taken prisoners, save some
old men, and a number of ladies; unfortunately
all these were ladies of distinction:
the preacher likewise was taken, who suffered
afterwards. The soldiers related of
this man, that when they came upon the
crowd, and fired among them, he was in
the middle of his afternoon prayer, and all
the people standing uncovered around him;
and that for all the shots, and the people
flying and falling dead about him, he never
so much as paused, nor took down his
hands, nor even opened his eyes, but concluded
a sentence in the same fervent tone,
after they had dragged him from the tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>At one or other of these unfortunate conventicles,
a part of all the chief families of
the Pringles, such as Torwoodlee, Whitebank,
Fairnilie, and others, were taken prisoners;
as well as some of the Scotts of
Harden, and the Douglasses of Cavers and
Boonjeddart; rich prizes for Clavers, who
bore them all in triumph prisoners to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Drummelzier put his whole interest to the
stretch to get these leading and respectable
families freed from such a disagreeable
dilemma, and succeeded in getting the
greater part of them set at liberty, on giving
securities. From that time forth, there
existed a secret jealousy between him and
Clavers; but as their jurisdiction lay on different
sides of the country, they had no
further interference with one another.</p>

<p>When Katharine informed him, that his
farmer, whom he so much esteemed, was
taken away a prisoner, and by whom, he
bit his lip, shook his head, and seemed
highly incensed. He then questioned her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
about all the charges against him, and the
evidence; requesting her, at the same
time, to tell him the truth, in all its bearings,
to the most minute scruple; and
when he had heard all, he said, that his
lordship had other motives for this capture
besides these. He lost no time in setting
about the most coercive measures he
could think of, to procure his liberty. He
sent an express to the Privy&#8211;council, and
wrote to sundry other gentlemen, whom
Katharine knew nothing of; but the destination
of Walter being utterly unknown to
either of them, the laird was at a loss how
to proceed.</p>

<p>He gave her, moreover, a bond of security,
signed with his name, and without a
direction, to a great amount, for her father&#8217;s
appearance at any court, to answer such
charges as were brought against him; and
with this she was to haste to the place
where her father was a prisoner, and present
it to the sheriff of the county, or chief
magistrate of the burgh of such place, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it was at Edinburgh, and in that case
she was to take no farther care or concern
about him.</p>

<p>She hasted home with her wild guide,
where she arrived the fourth or fifth day
after her departure; and found, to her astonishment,
the Chapelhope deserted by
man, woman, and boy! Not a living creature
remained about the steading, but her
father&#8217;s dog and some poultry! The doors
were locked, and the key away; and, hungry
and fatigued as she was, she could find
no means of admittance. At length, on
looking about, she perceived that the cows
were not about the house, nor any where
in the corn, and concluding that some one
must be herding them, she went up the side
of the lake to their wonted walk, and found
her two brothers attending the cattle.</p>

<p>They told her that the <i>town</i> (so they always
denominate a farm&#8211;steading in that
district,) had been so grievously haunted
in her absence, both by Brownie and a
ghost, that they were all obliged to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it; that their mother was gone all the
way to Gilmanscleuch to her brother, to remain
there until she saw what became of her
husband; Mass John was taken away by
the fairies; and old Nanny was at Riskinhope,
where they were also residing and
sleeping at night; that the keys of the
house were to be had there, but nothing
would induce Nanny to come back again to
Chapelhope, or at least to remain another
night under its roof.</p>

<p>One mischief came thus upon poor Katharine
after another; and she was utterly unable
to account for this piece of intelligence,
having been satisfied when she went away,
that she had put every thing in train to secure
peace and order about the house, until
her return. She rode to Riskinhope for
the key, but not one would accompany her
home, poor Nanny being lying moaning
upon a bed. Jasper sat on the side of the
hill, at a convenient distance from the house,
until her return; but then took her horse
from her, and put it away to the rest, refusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to enter the door. Thus was she
left in her father&#8217;s house all alone. Nanny
came over, and assisted her in milking the
kine evening and morning; and she remained
the rest of the day, and every night,
by herself, neither did she press any one
much to bear her company. She had no
one to send in search of her father, and
deliver Drummelzier&#8217;s bond, at least none
that any one knew of, yet it was sent, and
that speedily, although to little purpose;
for though Walter was sent to Dumfries
Jail, he remained there but two nights; a
party of prisoners, of ten men and two
women, being ordered for Edinburgh, under
a guard of soldiers, he was mixed indiscriminately
with the rest, and sent there
along with them.</p>

<p>He always said, that though he was disposed
to think well of Clavers before he
saw him, yet he never was so blithe in his
life as when he got from under his jurisdiction;
for there was an appearance of ferocity
and wantonness of cruelty in all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
proceedings, during the time that he rode
in his train a prisoner, that made the heart
of any man, not brutified by inurement to
such scenes, revolt at the principles that
induced, as well as the government that
warranted them. He saw him and his
troopers gather the whole vale of Annandale,
as a shepherd gathers his sheep in
droves, pricking the inhabitants with their
swords to urge their speed. When he got
thus all the people of a parish, or division
of a parish, driven together, he surrounded
them with his soldiers, made them
kneel by dozens, and take the oath of abjuration,
as well as one acknowledging
James Duke of York their rightful lord
and sovereign; and lastly, made them renounce
their right and part in Heaven, if
ever they repented them of that oath. The
first man of such a group, who refused or
objected to compliance with this dreadful
measure, he took him forthwith behind the
ranks and shot him, which summary way
of proceeding generally induced all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
people to comply. Moreover, the way in
which he threatened and maltreated children,
and mocked and insulted women, not
to mention more brutal usage of them, proved
him at once to be destitute of the behaviour
and feelings becoming a man, far
less those of a gentleman. He seemed to
regard all the commonalty in the south and
west of Scotland as things to be mocked and
insulted at pleasure, as beings created only
for the sport of him and his soldiers, while
their mental and bodily agonies were his
delight. The narrator of this tale confesses
that he has taken this account of his raid
through the vales of Esk and Annan solely
from tradition, as well as the attack made
on the two conventicles, where the Pringles,
&amp;c. were taken prisoners; but these traditions
are descended from such a source, and
by such a line, as amounts with him to veracity.</p>

<p>Far different were Walter&#8217;s feelings on
parting with the commander of his guard,
Serjeant Daniel Roy Macpherson, a noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
block from the genuine quarry of nature&#8212;rude
as it was taken thence, without the
mark of hammer or chisel. When he heard
that his prisoner was to be taken from under
his charge, he made up to him when
out of the eye of his commander, and treated
him with a parting speech; which, on
account of its singularity, is here preserved,
though, doubtless, woefully garbled by being
handed from one southland generation
to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now he&#8217;ll pe tahaking you away from
mhe pefore as it were yesterdhay; and
he&#8217;ll pe putting you into some vhile dark
hole with all te low tamn pwigs that come
from te hills of Gallochee and Drummochloonrich,
which is a shame and a disgrhace
to shut up a shentleman who is chief of a
clan among such poor crhazy maniachs,
who will pe filling your ears full of their
rejoicings in spirit; and of Haiven! and
Haiven! just as if they were all going to
Haiven! Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n, do they suppose that
Haiven is to pe filled full of such poor insignaificant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
crheatures as they? or that
Cot is not a shentleman, that he would pe
falling into such cohmpany? But I&#8217;ll pe
giving you advice as a friend and prhother;
when you come pefore the couhnsel, or any
of their commissioners, do not you pe talking
of Haiven, and Haiven, and of conscience
and covenants. And do not you pe
pragging and poasting of one to pe your
chief, or to pe of a clan that has not a friend
at court; but tell them your own clan, and
your claims to be its chief; and if you do
not know her true descent, you had better
claim Macpherson; she pe as ould and as
honourable a clan as any of them all, and
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter said, he trusted still to the proofs
of his own loyalty, and the want of evidence
to the contrary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! pooh! Cot tamn!&#8221; said Macpherson;
&#8220;I tell you the evidence you want
is this, if any great man say you ought to
live, you will live; if not, you will die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Did not I was telling you that the soholdiers
that were found dead in the correi, on the
lands that belong to yourself, was evidence
enough and more; I would not pe giving
<i>a curse</i> for <i>your</i> evidence after that, for the
one is much petter than te other. And py
Cot, it is very well thought!&#8221; continued he,
smiling grimly, &#8220;if you will pe preaking
out into a rage, and pe cursing and tamning
them all, you will get free in one moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter said, that would be an easy ransom,
and though it was an error he was too
apt to fall into when angry, he could see
no effect it could have in this case, but to irritate
his prosecutors more and more against
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see no effect! Cot t&#8209;&#8209;n, if you ever
can see any effect peyond the top that is
on your nose! and you will not pe advised
by a man of experience, who would do
more for you than he would pe commending
of; and if you trust to what you can see,
you will pe dancing a beautiful Highland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
shig in the air to a saulm tune, and that
will have a very good effect. I tell you,
when you come again to be questioned, I
know my Lord Dundee is to be there to pe
adducing his proof; take you great and
proud offence at some of their questions
and their proofs; and you may pe making
offer to fight them all one by one, or two
by two, in the king&#8217;s name, and send them
all to hell in one pody; you cannot pe
tamning them too much sore. By the soul
of Rory More Macpherson! I would almost
give up this claymore to be by and
see that effect. Now you are not to pe
minding because I am laughing like a fool,
for I&#8217;m perfectly serious; if matters should
pe standing hard with you, think of the advice
of an ould friend, who respects you as
the chief of the clan MacLeadle, supposing
it to pe as low, and as much fallen down as
it may.&#8212;Farewell! she pe giving you her
hearty Cot&#8217;s blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus parted he with Daniel Roy Macpherson,
and, as he judged, an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
change it was for him. The wretch who now
took the command of their guard had all the
ignorance and rudeness of the former, without
any counterbalance of high feeling and
honour like him. His name was Patie Ingles,
a temporary officer, the same who cut off
the head of the amiable Mr White with an
axe, at Kilmarnock, carried it to New&#8211;mills,
and gave it to his party to play a game with
at foot&#8211;ball, which they did. Ingles was drunk
during the greater part of the journey, and
his whole delight was in hurting, mortifying,
and mimicking his prisoners. They
were all bound together in pairs, and driven
on in that manner like coupled dogs.
This was effected by a very simple process.
Their hands were fastened behind, the right
and left arm of each pair being linked within
one another. Walter was tied to a little
spare Galloway weaver, a man wholly prone
to controversy&#8212;he wanted to argue every
point&#8212;on which account he was committed.
Yet, when among the Cameronians, he took
their principles as severely to task as he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
those of the other party when examined by
them. He lived but to contradict. Often
did he try Walter with different points of
opinion regarding the Christian Church.
Walter knew so little about them that the weaver
was astonished. He tried him with the
apologetical declaration. Walter had never
heard of it. He could make nothing of his
gigantic associate, and at length began a
sly enquiry on what account he was committed;
but even on that he received no
satisfactory information.</p>

<p>Ingles came staggering up with them.
&#8220;Weel, Master Skinflint, what say you to
it the day? This is a pleasant journey, is it
not? Eh?&#8212;I say, Master, what do they
call you! Peal&#8211;an&#8217;&#8211;eat, answer me in this&#8212;you
see&#8212;I say&#8212;Is it not delightful? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221; said the weaver, who
wished to be quit of him; &#8220;very delightful
to those who feel it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Feel</i> it so!&#8212;D&#8209;&#8209;n you, sirrah, what do
you mean by that? Do you know who you
are speaking to? Eh?&#8212;Answer me in this&#8212;What
do you mean by <i>Feel it so</i>? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>&#8220;I meant nothing,&#8221; returned the weaver,
somewhat snappishly, &#8220;but that kind
of respect which I always pay to gentry like
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentry like me!&#8212;D&#8209;&#8209;n you, sir, if you
speak such a&#8212;Eh?&#8212;Gentry like me!&#8212;I&#8217;ll
spit you like a cock pheasant&#8212;Eh? Have
you any of them in Galloway? Answer me
in this, will you? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer any reasonable thing, sir,&#8221;
said the poor weaver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hout! never head the creature, man,&#8221;
said Walter; &#8220;it&#8217;s a poor drunken senseless
beast of a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ingles fixed his reeling unsteady eyes
upon him, filled with drunken rage&#8212;walked
on, spitting and looking across the way for
a considerable space&#8212;&#8220;What the devil of
a whig camel is this?&#8221; said he, crossing over
to Walter&#8217;s side. &#8220;Drunken senseless beast
of a thing! Holm, did you hear that?&#8212;Macwhinny,
did you?&#8212;Eh? I&#8217;ll scorn to
shoot the cusser, though I could do it&#8212;Eh?
But I&#8217;ll kick him like a dog&#8212;Eh?&#8212;Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
that, and that, will you? Eh?&#8221; And
so saying, he kicked our proud&#8211;hearted and
independant Goodman of Chapelhope with
his plebeian foot, staggering backward each
time he struck.</p>

<p>Walter&#8217;s spirit could not brook this; and
disregardful of all consequences, he wheeled
about with his face toward him, dragging
the weaver round with a jerk, as a mastiff
sometimes does a spaniel that is coupled to
him; and, as Ingles threw up his foot to
kick him on the belly, he followed up his
heel with his foot, giving him such a fling
upwards as made him whirl round in the air
like a reel. He fell on his back, and lay
motionless; on which, several of the party
of soldiers levelled their muskets at Walter.
&#8220;Ay, shoot,&#8221; said he, setting up his boardly
breast to them&#8212;&#8220;Shoot at me if you
dare, the best o&#8217; ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers cocked their pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Colonel himsel durstna wrang a
hair o&#8217; my head, though fain he wad hae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
done sae, without first gieing me ower to
his betters&#8212;Let me see if a scullion amang
ye a&#8217; dare do mair than he.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers turned their eyes, waiting
for the word of command; and the weaver
kept as far away from Walter as the nature
of his bonds would let him. The command
of the party now devolved on a Serjeant
Douglas; who, perhaps nothing sorry for
what had happened, stepped in between the
soldiers and prisoner, and swore a great
oath, that &#8220;what the prisoner said was the
truth; and that all that it was their duty to
do was, to take the prisoners safe to Edinburgh,
as at first ordered; and there give
their evidence of this transaction, which
would send the lousy whig to hell at once,
provided there was any chance of his otherwise
escaping.&#8221;</p>

<p>They lifted Ingles, and held him up into
the air to get breath, loosing meantime his
cravat and clothes; on which he fell to vomit
severely, owing to the fall he had got,
and the great quantity of spirits he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
drunk. They waited on him for about two
hours; but as he still continued unable
either to speak or walk, they took him into
a house called Granton, and proceeded on
their destination.</p>

<p>This Douglas, though apparently a superior
person to the former commander of
the party, was still more intolerant and
cruel than he. There was no indignity or
inconvenience that he could fasten on his
prisoners which he did not exercise to the
utmost. They lodged that night at a place
called Tweedshaws; and Walter used always
to relate an occurrence that took
place the next morning, that strongly marked
the character of this petty officer, as well
as the licensed cruelty of the times.</p>

<p>Some time previous to this, there had
been a fellowship meeting, at a place called
Tallo&#8211;Lins, of the wanderers that lurked
about Chapelhope and the adjacent mountains.
About eighty had assembled, merely
to spend the night in prayer, reading the
Scriptures, &amp;c. The curate of Tweedsmuir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a poor dissolute wretch, sent a flaming
account of this in writing to the privy council,
magnifying that simple affair to a great
and dangerous meeting of armed men. The
council took the alarm, raised the hue and
cry, and offered a reward for the apprehending
of any one who had been at the
meeting of Tallo&#8211;Lins. The curate, learning
that a party of the king&#8217;s troops was
lodged that night in his parish and neighbourhood,
came to Tweedshaws at a late
hour, and requested to speak with the captain
of the party. He then informed Douglas
of the meeting, shewed him the council&#8217;s
letter and proclamation, and finally
told him that there was a man in a cottage
hard by whom he strongly suspected to
have formed one at the meeting alluded to
in the proclamation. There being no conveniency
for lodging so many people at
Tweedshaws, Douglas and the curate drank
together all the night, as did the soldiers
in another party. A number of friends to
the prisoners had given them money when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
they left Dumfries for Edinburgh, to supply
as well as they might the privations to
which they would be subjected; but here
the military took the greater part of it from
them to supply their intemperance. About
the break of day, they went and surrounded
a shepherd&#8217;s cottage belonging to the
farm of Corehead, having been led thither
by the curate, where they found the shepherd
an old man, his daughter, and one
Edward M&#8217;Cane, son to a merchant in Lanarkshire,
who was courting this shepherdess,
a beautiful young maiden. The
curate having got intelligence that a stranger
was at that house, immediately suspected
him to be one of the wanderers, and on
this surmise the information was given.
The curate acknowledged the shepherd and
his daughter as parishioners, but of M&#8217;Cane,
he said, he knew nothing, and had no
doubt that he was one of the rebellious
whigs. They fell to examine the youth,
but they were all affected with the liquor
they had drunk over night, and made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
mere farce of it, paying no regard to his
answers, or, if they did, it was merely to
misconstrue or mock them. He denied having
been at the meeting at Tallo&#8211;Linns,
and all acquaintance with the individuals
whom they named as having been there
present. Finding that they could make nothing
of him whereon to ground a charge,
Douglas made them search him for arms;
for being somewhat drunk, he took it highly
amiss that he should have been brought
out of his way for nothing. M&#8217;Cane judged
himself safe on that score, for he knew that
he had neither knife, razor, bodkin, nor
edged instrument of any kind about him;
but as ill luck would have it, he chanced
to have an old gun&#8211;flint in his waistcoat
pocket. Douglas instantly pronounced this
to be sufficient, and ordered him to be
shot. M&#8217;Cane was speechless for some time
with astonishment, and at length told his
errand, and the footing on which he stood
with the young girl before them, offering
at the same time to bring proofs from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
own parish of his loyalty and conformity.
He even condescended to kneel to the ruffian,
to clasp his knees, and beg and beseech
of him to be allowed time for a regular
proof; but nothing would move him.
He said, the courtship was a very clever
excuse, but would not do with him, and
forthwith ordered him to be shot. He
would not even allow him to sing a psalm
with his two friends, but cursed and swore
that the devil a psalm he should sing there.
He said, &#8220;It would not be singing a few
verses of a psalm in a wretched and miserable
style that would keep him out of hell;
and if he went to heaven, he might then
lilt as much at psalm&#8211;singing as he had a
mind.&#8221; When the girl, his betrothed sweet&#8211;heart,
saw the muskets levelled at her lover,
she broke through the file, shrieking most
piteously, threw herself on him, clasped his
neck and kissed him, crying, like one distracted,
&#8220;O Edward, take me wi&#8217; ye&#8212;take
me wi&#8217; ye; a&#8217; the warld sanna part us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mary,&#8221; said he, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>&#8220;last night we
looked forward to long and happy years&#8212;how
joyful were our hopes! but they are
all blasted at once. Be comforted, my
dearest, dearest heart!&#8212;God bless you!&#8212;Farewell
forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers then dragged her backward,
mocking her with indelicate remarks, and
while she was yet scarcely two paces removed,
and still stretching out her hands
towards him, six balls were lodged in his
heart in a moment, and he fell dead at her
feet. Deformed and bloody as he was, she
pressed the corpse to her bosom, moaning
and sobbing in such a way as if every throb
would have been her last, and in that condition
the soldiers marched merrily off and
left them. For this doughty and noble
deed, for which Serjeant Douglas deserved
to have been hanged and quartered, he
shortly after got a cornetcy in Sir Thomas
Livingston&#8217;s troop of horse.</p>

<p>Two of the prisoners made their escape
that morning, owing to the drunkenness of
their guards, on which account the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
being blamed, were more haughtily and
cruelly treated than ever. It is necessary
to mention all these, as they were afterwards
canvassed at Walter&#8217;s trial, the account
of which formed one of his winter
evening tales as long as he lived. Indeed,
all such diffuse and miscellaneous matter as
is contained in this chapter, is a great incumbrance
in the right onward progress of
a tale; but we have done with it, and shall
now haste to the end of our narrative in a
direct uninterrupted line.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>The sudden departure of Katharine from
home, after the extraordinary adventure
of the curate Clerk in the Old Room, at the
crowing of the cock, was a great relief to
him, as it freed him from the embarrassment
of her company, and gave him an
opportunity of telling his own story to
the goodwife without interruption, of the
success he had in freeing her daughter
from the power and fellowship of evil spirits.
That story was fitted admirably to
suit her weak and superstitious mind; it
accorded with any thing nearer than the
truth, and perhaps this finished hypocrite
never appeared so great a character in the
eyes of Maron Linton as he did that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
He spoke of going away to Henderland in
the evening, but she entreated him so earnestly
to stay and protect her from the
power of the spirits that haunted the place,
that he deemed it proper to acquiesce, for
without the countenance of the family of
Chapelhope he was nothing&#8212;he could not
have lived in his puny cure. She depended
on him, she said, to rid the town of these
audacious (or, as she called them, <i>misleared</i>)
beings altogether, for without his interference
the family would be ruined.
Their servants had all left them&#8212;the work
remained unwrought, and every thing was
going to confusion&#8212;she had given Brownie
his accustomed wages again and again, and
still he refused to leave the house; and without
the holy man&#8217;s assistance in expelling
him and his train, their prospects in life were
hopeless.</p>

<p>The curate promised to use his highest
interest with Heaven, and assured her that
no further evil should come nigh unto her,
at least while he remained under her roof;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
&#8220;for were it not,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for the conjunction
which they are in with one of the
family, they should have been expelled long
ere now. That unnatural bond, I hope, by
a course of secret conferences, to be able
to break asunder, but be not thou afraid,
for no evil shall come nigh thy dwelling.&#8221;
He talked with the goodwife in the style
that pleased her; flattered her high and
pure notions of religion, as well as her
piety and benevolence; said evening prayers
in the family with zeal and devotion;
but how was he startled when informed that
he was to sleep again in the Old Room! He
indeed knew not that it was haunted more
than any other part of the house, or that
it was the favourite nightly resort of the
Brownie of Bodsbeck, but the apparition
that he had seen, and the unaccountable
rescue that he had witnessed the night before,
preyed on his mind, and he hinted to
the goodwife, that he had expected to be
preferred to her daughter&#8217;s room and bed
that night, as she was absent; but Maron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
too, was selfish; for who is without that
great ruling motive? She expected that
Brownie would appear; that Mass John
would speak to it; and thenceforward to
be freed from its unwelcome intrusions.
To the Old Room he was shown at a late
hour, where the lamp, the Bible, and the
<i>sand&#8211;glass</i> were placed on the little table,
at the bed&#8217;s head, as usual.</p>

<p>It was past eleven when the curate went
to sleep. Old Nanny, who was dressed
more neatly than usual, sat still at the kitchen
fire, expecting every minute the two
covenant&#8211;men, whom her young mistress
had promised to send to her privily, as her
companions and protectors through the
dark and silent watches of the night until
her return. Still nothing of them appeared;
but, confident that they would appear,
she stirred the embers of the fire, and continued
to keep watch with patient anxiety.
When it drew towards midnight, as she
judged, she heard a noise without, as of
some people entering, or trying to enter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
by the outer door of the Old Room. Concluding
that it was her expected companions,
and alarmed at the wrong direction
they had taken, she ran out, and round
the west end of the house, to warn them
of their mistake, and bring them in by the
kitchen door. As she proceeded, she heard
two or three loud and half&#8211;stifled howls
from the interior of the Old Room. The
door was shut, but, perceiving by the seam
in the window&#8211;shutters that the light within
was still burning, she ran to the window,
which directly faced the curate&#8217;s bed; and
there being a small aperture broken in one
of the panes, she edged back the shutter,
so as to see and hear the most part of what
was going on within. She saw four or five
figures standing at the bed, resembling human
figures in some small degree&#8212;their
backs towards her; but she saw a half&#8211;face
of one that held the lamp in its hand, and
it was of the hue of a smoked wall. In the
midst of them stood the deformed little
Brownie, that has often been mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and described in the foregoing part of this
tale. In his right hand he brandished a
weapon, resembling a dirk or carving&#8211;knife.
The other hand he stretched out, half&#8211;raised
over the curate&#8217;s face, as if to command attention.
&#8220;Peace!&#8221; said he, &#8220;thou child
of the bottomless pit, and minister of unrighteousness;
another such sound from
these polluted lips of thine, and I plunge
this weapon into thy heart. We would
shed thy blood without any reluctance&#8212;nay,
know thou that we would rejoice to
do it, as thereby we would render our master
acceptable service. Not for that intent
or purpose are we now come; yet thy abominations
shall not altogether pass unpunished.
Thou knowest thy own heart&#8212;its
hypocrisy, and licentiousness&#8212;Thou
knowest, that last night, at this same
hour, thou didst attempt, by brutal force,
to pollute the purest and most angelic of
the human race&#8212;we rescued her from thy
hellish clutch, for we are her servants, and
attend upon her steps. Thou knowest, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
still thou art cherishing the hope of succeeding
in thy cursed scheme. Thou art a
stain to thy profession, and a blot upon the
cheek of nature, enough to make thy race
and thy nation stink in the nose of their
Creator!&#8212;To what thou deservest, thy
doom is a lenient one&#8212;but it is fixed and
irrevocable!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in that mis&#8211;shapen
creature&#8217;s voice that chilled Nanny&#8217;s very
soul while it spoke these words, especially
its pronunciation of some of them; it
sounded like something she had heard before,
perhaps in a dream, but it was horrible,
and not to be brooked. The rest now
laid violent hold of Mass John, and she
heard him mumbling in a supplicating
voice, but knew not what he said. As
they stooped forward, the lamp shone on
the floor, and she saw the appearance of a
coffin standing behind them. Nanny was
astonished, but not yet overcome; for,
cruel were the scenes that she had beheld,
and many the trials she had undergone!&#8212;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
at that instant the deformed and grizly
being turned round, as if looking for something
that it wanted&#8212;the lamp shone full
on its face, the lineaments of which when
Nanny beheld, her eyes at once were darkened,
and she saw no more that night.
How she spent the remainder of it, or by
what means she got to her bed in the kitchen,
she never knew; but next morning
when the goodwife and her sons arose, poor
old Nanny was lying in the kitchen bed delirious,
and talking of dreadful and incomprehensible
things. All that could be gathered
from her frenzy was, that some terrible
catastrophe had happened in the Old
Room, and that Clerk, the curate, was implicated
in it. The goodwife, judging that
her favourite had been at war with the
spirits, and that Heaven had been of course
triumphant, hasted to the Old Room to
bless and pay the honour due to such a divine
character; she called his name as she
entered, but no one made answer; she
hasted to the bed, but behold there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
no one there! The goodwife&#8217;s sole spiritual
guide had vanished away.</p>

<p>The curate Clerk was never more seen
nor heard of in these bounds; but it may
not be improper here to relate a circumstance
that happened some time thereafter,
as it comes no more within the range of
this story.</p>

<p>In the month of October, and the memorable
year 1688, it is well known that Clavers
hasted southward, with all the troops
under his command, to assist King James
against the Prince of Orange and the protestant
party of England, or to sell himself
to the latter, any of the ways that he found
most convenient. In the course of this
march, as he was resting his troops at a
place called Ninemile&#8211;brae, near the Border,
a poor emaciated and forlorn&#8211;looking
wretch came to him, and desired to speak a
word with him. Mr Adam Copland and
he were sitting together when this happened;
Clavers asked his name and his business,
for none of the two recognised him&#8212;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was Clerk, the curate (that had been) of
Chapelhope and Kirkhope! Clavers said,
as there were none present save a friend,
he might say out his business. This he declined,
and took Clavers a short way aside.
Copland watched their motions, but could
not hear what Clerk said. When he began
to tell his story Clavers burst into a violent
fit of laughter, but soon restrained himself,
and Copland beheld him knitting his brows,
and biting his lip, as he seldom failed to do
when angry. When they parted, he heard
him saying distinctly, &#8220;It is impossible
that I can avenge your wrongs at this time,
for I have matters of great import before
me; but the day may come ere long when
it will be in my power, and d&#8209;&#8209;n me if I
do not do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The spirits of the wild having been victorious,
and the reverend curate, the goodwife&#8217;s
only stay, overcome and carried off
bodily, she was impatient, and on the rack
every minute that she staid longer about
the house. She caused one of her sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
take a horse, and conduct her to Gilmanscleuch
that night, to her brother Thomas&#8217;s
farm, determined no more to see Chapelhope
till her husband&#8217;s return; and if that
should never take place, to bid it adieu for
ever.</p>

<p>Nanny went to the led farm of Riskinhope,
that being the nearest house to Chapelhope,
and just over against it, in order
to take what care she was able of the things
about the house during the day. There
also the two boys remained, and herded
throughout the day in a very indifferent
manner; and, in short, every thing about
the farm was going fast to confusion when
Katharine returned from her mission to the
Laird of Drummelzier. Thus it was that
she found her father&#8217;s house deserted, its
doors locked up, and its hearth cold.</p>

<p>Her anxiety to converse privately with
Nanny was great; but at her first visit, when
she went for the key, this was impossible
without being overheard. She soon, however,
found an opportunity; for that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
she enticed her into the byre at Chapelhope,
in the gloaming, after the kine had
left the lone, where a conversation took
place between them in effect as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, Nanny! how has all this happened?
Did not the two Covenanters, for whom
I sent, come to bear you company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear bairn, if they did come I saw nae
them. If they came, they were ower late,
for the spirits were there afore them; an&#8217; I
hae seen sic a sight! Dear, dear bairn, dinna
gar me gang owre it again&#8212;I hae seen
a sight that&#8217;s enough to turn the heart
o&#8217; flesh to an iceshogle, an&#8217; to freeze up
the very springs o&#8217; life!&#8212;Dinna gar me
gang ower it again, an&#8217; rake up the ashes o&#8217;
the honoured dead&#8212;But what need I say
sae? The dead are up already! Lord in
Heaven be my shield and safeguard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanny, you affright me; but, be assured,
your terrors have originated in some
mistake&#8212;your sight has deceived you, and
all shall yet be explained to your satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&#8220;Say nae sae, dear bairn; my sight hasna
deceived me, yet I have been deceived.
The world has deceived me&#8212;hell has deceived
me&#8212;and heaven has winked at the
deed. Alak, an&#8217; wae&#8217;s me, that it should
sae hae been predestined afore the world
began! The day was, an&#8217; no sae lang sin&#8217;
syne, when I could hae prayed wi&#8217; confidence,
an&#8217; sung wi&#8217; joy; but now my mind
is overturned, and I hae nouther stay on
earth, nor hope in heaven! The veil of the
Temple may be rent below, and the ark of
the testimony thrown open above, but <i>their</i>
forms will not be seen within the one, nor
their names found written in the other!
We have been counted as sheep for the
slaughter; we have been killed all the day
long; yet hath the Lord forgotten to be
gracious, and is his mercy clean gone for
ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, peace, for Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8212;You
are verging on blasphemy, and know
not what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>&#8220;Do the reprobate know what they say,
or can they forbear? How then can I? I,
who am in the bond of iniquity, and the
jaws of death eternal?&#8212;Where can I fly?
When the righteous are not saved, where
shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?&#8212;Ay,
dear bairn, weel may ye stare and raise
up your hands that gate; but when ye hear
my tale, ye winna wonder that my poor
wits are uprooted. Suppose sic a case your
ain&#8212;suppose you had been the bosom companion
o&#8217; ane for twenty years&#8212;had joined
wi&#8217; him in devotion, e&#8217;ening and morning,
for a&#8217; that time, and had never heard a sigh
but for sin, nor a complaint but of the iniquities
of the land&#8212;If ye had witnessed
him follow two comely sons, your own flesh
and blood, to the scaffold, and bless his
God who put it in their hearts to stand and
suffer for his cause, and for the crown of
martyrdom he had bestowed on them, and
bury the mangled bodies of other two with
tears, but not with repining&#8212;If, after a&#8217;
this, he had been hunted as a partridge on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the mountains, and for the same dear cause,
the simplicity of the truth as it is in Jesus,
had laid down his life&#8212;If you knew that
his grey head was hung upon the city wall
for a spectacle to gaze at, and his trunk buried
in the wild by strangers&#8212;Say you
knew all this, and had all these dear ties in
your remembrance, and yet, after long
years of hope soon to join their blest society
above, to see again that loved and revered
form stand before your eyes on earth
at midnight, shrivelled, pale, and deformed,
and mixed with malevolent spirits on dire
and revengeful intent, where wad your hope&#8212;where
wad your confidence&#8212;or where
wad your wits hae been flown?&#8221; Here she
cried bitterly; and seizing the astonished
Katharine&#8217;s hand with both hers, and pressing
it to her brow, she continued her impassioned
and frantic strain.&#8212;&#8220;Pity me, O
dear bairn, pity me! For man hasna pitied
me, an&#8217; God hasna pitied me! I&#8217;m gaun
down a floody water, down, down; an&#8217; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
wad fain grip at something, if it were but a
swoomin strae, as a last hope, or I sink a&#8217;
thegither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the words of delirium,&#8221; said
Katharine, &#8220;and I will not set them down
as spoke by you. Pray the Almighty that
they may never be written in his book of
remembrance against you; for the veriest
downfallen fiend can do no more than distrust
the mercy of God in a Redeemer. I
tell you, woman, that whatever you may
fancy you have seen or heard in the darkness
of night, when imagination forms fantasies
of its own, of all those who have stood
for our civil and religious liberties, who,
for the sake of a good conscience, have
yielded up all, and sealed their testimony
with their blood, not one hair of <i>their</i> heads
shall fall to the ground, for their names are
written in the book of life, and they shall
shine as stars in the kingdom of their Father.
You have yourself suffered much, and
have rejoiced in your sufferings&#8212;So far you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
did well&#8212;Do not then mar so fair an eternal
harvest&#8212;so blest a prospect of a happy
and everlasting community, by the sin of
despair, that can never be forgiven. Can
you, for a moment, while in possession of
your right senses, doubt of the tender mercies
of your Maker and Preserver? Can
you for a moment believe that he has hid
his face from the tears and the blood that
have been shed for his cause in Scotland?
As well may you doubt that the earth bears
or the sun warms you, or that he never
made a revelation of his will to man.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the while that Katharine spoke thus,
Nanny&#8217;s eyes were fixed on her, as if drinking
every word she uttered into a soul that
thirsted for it. A wild and unstable light
beamed on her countenance, but it was still
only like a sun&#8211;beam breaking through the
storm, which is ready to be swallowed up
by the rolling darkness within. Her head
shook as with a slight paralytic affection,
and she again clasped the hand which she
had never quitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;Are ye an angel o&#8217; light,&#8221; said she, in a
soft tremulous voice, &#8220;that ye gar my
heart prinkle sae wi&#8217; a joy that it never
thought again to taste? It isna then a strae
nor a stibble that I hae grippit at for my
last hope, but the tap of a good tow&#8211;widdy
saugh; an&#8217; a young sapling though it be,
it is steevely rootit in a good soil, an&#8217; will
maybe help the poor drowning wretch to
the shore!&#8212;An&#8217; <i>hae</i> I thought sae muckle
ill o&#8217; you? Could I deem that mild heavenly
face, that&#8217;s but the reflection o&#8217; the soul
within, the image o&#8217; sin and o&#8217; Satan, an&#8217; a
veil o&#8217; deceit thrawn ower a mind prone to
wickedness? Forgie me, dear, dear saint,
forgie me! It surely canna be condemned
spirits that ye are connectit wi? Ah, ye&#8217;re
dumb there!&#8212;ye darna answer me to that!
Na, na! the spirits o&#8217; the just made perfect
wad never leave their abodes o&#8217; felicity to
gabble amang derksome fiends at the dead
hour o&#8217; the night, in sic a world o&#8217; sin and
sorrow as this. But I saw <i>him</i>, an&#8217; heard
him speak, as sure as I see your face an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
hear the tones o&#8217; my ain voice; an&#8217;, if I
lookit nae wrang, there were mae risen frae
the dead than ane. It is an awfu&#8217; dispensation
to think o&#8217;! But there was a spirit o&#8217;
retaliation in him that often made me quake,
though never sae as now. O wad ye but
tell me what kind o&#8217; spirits ye are in conjunction
wi&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None but the blest and the happy&#8212;None
but they who have come out of great
tribulation, and washed their robes white in
the blood of the Lamb&#8212;None that would
harbour such a thought, or utter such a
doubt, as you have done to&#8211;night, for the
empire of the universe&#8212;More I may not
tell you at present; but stay you here with
me, and I will cherish you, and introduce
you to these spirits, and you shall be happier
with them than ever you have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I sae?&#8212;Say nae mair!&#8212;I wad pit
hand to my ain life the night, an&#8217; risk the
warst or I again met wi&#8217; them face to face
in the same guise as I saw them at midnight
last week. Ye&#8217;re a wonderfu&#8217; creature!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
But ye&#8217;re ayont my depth; therefore
I&#8217;ll love ye, an&#8217; fear ye, an&#8217; keep my distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they parted: Katharine into her
long vacant house, and Nanny over to Riskinhope.
The farmer of Riskinhope (David
Bryden of Eldin&#8211;hope), was ruined by
the sequestration of his stock by Clavers,
but the shepherds and other servants still
lingered about the house for better or for
worse. There was not a sheep on that
large farm, save about five scores of good
ewes, that Davie Tait, the herd of Whithope,
had turned slyly over into the hags
of the Yokeburn&#8211;head, that day the drivers
took away the stock. When Clavers made
his last raid up by Chapelhope, all the family
of Riskinhope fled to the hills, and
betook them to cover, every one by himself;
and there, with beating hearts, peeped
through the heath and the rash&#8211;bush, to
watch the motions of that bloody persecutor.
Perilous was their case that day, for
had any of them been found in that situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
it would have been enough; but Davie
well knew it was good for him to keep
out of the way, for Mr Renwick, and Mr
Shields, as well as other wanderers, had
been sheltered in his house many a night,
and the latter wrote his <i>Hind let Loose</i>
in a small house at the side of Winterhopeburn.
Yet Davie was not a Cameronian,
properly speaking, nor a very religious
man neither; but the religious enthusiasm
of his guests had broke him a little into
their manner, and way of thinking. He
had learned to make family exercise, not
however to very great purpose, for the
only thing very remarkable in it was the
strong nasal Cameronian whine of his prayer,
and its pastoral allusions; but he was
grown fond of exhibiting in that line, having
learned the Martyr&#8217;s tune, and the second
part of the Dundee, which formed
the whole range of his psalmody! Yet Davie
liked a joke as well as ever he did, and
perhaps as well as any part of divine worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
When one remarked to him that his
family music was loud enough, but very
discordant,&#8212;&#8220;Ay,&#8221; quoth Davie, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
a lang gate atween here an&#8217; Heaven; a&#8217;
music&#8217;s good i&#8217; the distance; I hae strong
faith in that. I hae some hope i&#8217; Dan&#8217;s bass
too; it has <i>great effect</i>. I was wantin him
to tak some salts an&#8217; sinny leaf to help it a
wee.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night after Nanny came over, Davie
had prayed as usual, and among other
things, had not forgot the Brownie of Bodsbeck,
that &#8220;he might be skelpit wi&#8217; the
taws o&#8217; divine wrath, an&#8217; sent back to hell
wi&#8217; the sperks on his hips; and that the angel
of presence might keep watch over their
couches that night, to scare the howlaty
face o&#8217; him away, an&#8217; learn him to keep his
ain side o&#8217; the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>After prayers the family were crowded
round the fading ingle, and cracking of
the Brownie and of Davie&#8217;s prayer. Davie
had opened his waistcoat, and thrown off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his hose to warm his feet, and, flattered
with their remarks on his abilities, began
to be somewhat scurrilous on Brownie. &#8220;I
think I hae cowed him the night,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;he&#8217;ll fash nane o&#8217; us&#8212;he may stay wi&#8217; his
Keatie Laidlaw yonder, an&#8217; rin at her biddin.
He has a sonsy weel&#8211;faur&#8217;d lass to
bide wi&#8217;&#8212;he&#8217;s better aff than some o&#8217; his
neighbours, Maysey;&#8221; and, saying so, he
cast a look to his wife that spoke unutterable
things; but finding that his joke did
not take, after so serious a prayer, he turned
again on Brownie, and, as his own wife
said, &#8220;didna leave him the likeness of a
dog.&#8221; He said he had eaten sax bowes o&#8217;
good meal to the goodman, an&#8217; a&#8217; that he
had done for&#8217;t, that ony body kend o&#8217;, was
mending up an auld fail&#8211;dike round the
corn ae night. In short, he said he was an
unprofitable guest&#8212;a dirty droich, an&#8217; a
menseless glutton&#8212;an&#8217; it was weak an&#8217; silly
in ony true Christian to be eiry for him.
He had not said out the last words, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
they heard a whispering at the door, and
shortly after these words distinctly uttered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There&#8217;s neither blood nor rown&#8211;tree pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At open doors the dogs go in.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The size of every eye&#8217;s orbit was doubled
in a moment, as it turned towards the door.
The light of the fire was shining bright
along the short entry between the beds,
and they saw the appearance of a man,
clothed in black, come slowly and deliberately
in, walk across the entry, and go into
the apartment in the other end of the house.
The family were all above one another in
beyond the fire in an instant, and struggling
who to be undermost, and next the wall.
Nanny, who was sitting on the form beyond
the fire, pondering on other matters,
leaning her brow on both hands, and all
unconscious of what had entered, was overborne
in the crush, and laid flat undermost
of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear bairns, what&#8217;s asteer? Hout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fy! Why, troth, ye&#8217;ll crush the poor auld
body as braid as a blood&#8211;kercake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! the Brownie!&#8212;the Brownie!&#8212;the
Brownie o&#8217; Bodsbeck!&#8221; was whispered
in horror from every tongue.</p>

<p>Davie Tait luckily recollecting that there
was a door at hand, that led to a little milk&#8211;house
in the other end of the house, and
still another division farther from Brownie,
led the way to it on all four, at full gallop,
and took shelter in the farthest corner of
that. All the rest were soon above him,
but Davie bore the oppressive weight with
great fortitude for some time, and without
a murmur. Nanny was left last; she kept
hold of the Bible that she had in her lap
when she fell, and had likewise the precaution
to light the lamp before she followed
her affrighted associates. Nothing could
be more appalling than her own entry after
them&#8212;never was a figure more calculated
to inspire terror, than Nanny coming carrying
a feeble glimmering lamp, that only
served to make darkness visible, while her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
pale raised&#8211;like features were bent over it,
eager to discover her rueful compeers.
The lamp was half&#8211;covered with her hand
to keep it from being blown out; and her
face, where only a line of light here and
there was visible, was altogether horrible.
Having discovered the situation, and the
plight of the family, she bolted the door
behind her, and advanced slowly up to
them. &#8220;Dear bairns, what did ye see that
has putten ye a&#8217; this gate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord sauf us!&#8221; cried Davie, from below,
&#8220;we hae forespoke the Brownie&#8212;tak
that elbow out o&#8217; my guts a wee bit. They
say, if ye speak o&#8217; the deil, he&#8217;ll appear. &#8217;Tis
an unsonsy and dangerous thing to&#8212;Wha&#8217;s
aught that knee? slack it a little. God
guide us, sirs, there&#8217;s the weight of a mill&#8211;stane
on aboon the links o&#8217; my neck. If
the Lord hae forsaken us, an&#8217; winna heed
our prayers, we may gie up a&#8217; for tint thegither!&#8212;Nanny,
hae ye boltit the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay hae I, firm an&#8217; fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Than muve up a wee, sirs, or faith I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
gane&#8212;Hech&#8211;howe! the weight o&#8217; sin an&#8217;
mortality that&#8217;s amang ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davie&#8217;s courage, that had begun to mount
on hearing that the door was bolted, soon
gave way again, when he raised his head,
and saw the utter dismay that was painted
on each countenance. &#8220;Hout, Maysey
woman, dinna just mak sic faces&#8212;ye are
eneuch to fright fock, foreby aught else,&#8221;
said he to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Davie, think what a wheen poor
helpless creatures we are!&#8212;Does Brownie
ever kill ony body?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it be nae a waur thing than
Brownie,&#8221; said Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waur than Brownie? Mercy on us!&#8212;Waur
than Brownie!&#8212;What was it like?&#8221;
was whispered round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye mind poor Kirko, the bit Dinscore
laird, that skulkit hereabouts sae lang, an&#8217;
sleepit several nights ben in that end?&#8212;Didna
ye a&#8217; think it was unco like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very man!&#8212;the very man!&#8212;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
make, his gang, his claes, an&#8217; every thing,&#8221;
was echoed by all.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye ken,&#8221; continued Dan, &#8220;that he
was shot on Dumfries sands this simmer.
It is his ghaist come to haunt the place
whar he baid, an&#8217; prayed sae aften.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ower true! Ower true! it&#8217;s awsome to
think o&#8217;,&#8221; was the general remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go to prayers,&#8221; said Nanny:
&#8220;it isna a time to creep into nooks on
aboon other, an&#8217; gie way to despair. There
is but Ane that <i>can</i> guard or protect us, let
us apply there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has been done that way already,&#8221;
said Davie Tait; &#8220;we canna come
to handygrips wi&#8217; him, an&#8217; force him to
stand senter at our door a&#8217; night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davie&#8217;s matter was exhausted on the
subject, and he did not much relish going
over the same words again, which, he acknowledged,
were <i>rather kenspeckle</i>; nor
yet to venture on composing new ones out
of his own head: this made him disposed
to waive Nanny&#8217;s proposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered she, &#8220;but we mauna
haud just wi&#8217; saying gie us this, an&#8217; gie us
that; and than, because we dinna just get
it aff loof, drap the plea an&#8217; despair. Na,
na, dear bairns, that&#8217;s nae part o&#8217; the christian
warfare! we maun plead wi&#8217; humility,
and plead again, an&#8217; never was there mair
cause for rousing to exertion than now.
The times are momentous, and some great
change is drawing near, for the dead are
astir&#8212;I have seen them mysel&#8217;. Yes, the
severed members that were scattered, and
buried apart, are come thegither again&#8212;joined,
an&#8217; gaun aboon the grund, mouthing
the air o&#8217; Heaven. I saw it mysel&#8212;Can
it be that the resurrection is begun?
It is a far away thought for the thing itsel
to be as near; but it&#8217;s a glorious ane, an&#8217;
there&#8217;s proof o&#8217;t. But then the place an&#8217;
the time are doubtfu&#8217;&#8212;had it been sun
proof I wad hae likit it better. We little
wot what to say or think under sic visitations.
Let us apply to the only source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
light and direction. David, be you a
mouth to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mouth?&#8221; said Davie; but recollecting
himself, added&#8212;&#8220;Hum, I understand
you; but I hae mouthed mair already than
has come to ony good. I like fock to pray
that hae some chance to be heard; some
fock may scraugh themsels hersh, and be
nae the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh fie, David! speak wi&#8217; some reverence,&#8221;
said his wife Maysey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mintit at naething else,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but I hae an unreverent kind o&#8217; tongue
that nought ever serous&#8211;like fa&#8217;s frae, let
my frame o&#8217; mind be as it will; an&#8217; troth
I haena command o&#8217; language for a job
like this. I trow the prelates hae the best
way after a&#8217;, for they get prayers ready
made to their hands, an&#8217; disna need to affront
their Maker wi&#8217; blunders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can ye speak sae the night, David?
or how can sic a thought hover round
your heart as to flee out at random that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
gate? If ye will <i>read</i> prayers, there&#8217;s a
book, read them out o&#8217; that; if the words
o&#8217; God winna suit the cases o&#8217; his ain creatures,
how can ye trow the words o&#8217; another
man can do it? But pray wi&#8217; the
heart, an&#8217; pray in humility, and fearna being
accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true; but yet ane maks but a
poor figure wi&#8217; the heart by itsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, Davie, man,&#8221; quoth Maysey, his
wife, &#8220;an&#8217; ye mak but a poor figure indeed,
when we&#8217;re a&#8217; in sic a plight! Ye
hear the woman speaks gude truth; an&#8217; ye
ken yoursel ye fenced us against the Brownie
afore, but no against Kirky&#8217;s ghaist; tak
the beuk like a man, an&#8217; pit the fence o&#8217;
scripture faith round us for that too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stupid as Maysey was, she knew the way
to her husband&#8217;s heart. Davie could not
resist such an appeal&#8212;he took the Bible;
sung the 143d psalm, from beginning to
end, at Nanny&#8217;s request; and likewise, by
her direction, read the 20th of Revelations;
then kneeling down on his bare knees, legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and feet, as he fled from the kitchen, on
the damp miry floor of the milk&#8211;house, he
essayed a strong energetic prayer as a fence
against the invading ghost. But as Davie acknowledged,
he had an irreverend expression
naturally, that no effort could overcome,
(and by the bye, there is more in this than
mankind are in general aware of,) and the
more he aimed at sublimity, the more ludicrous
he grew, even to common ears. There
is scarcely a boy in the country who cannot
recite scraps of Davie Tait&#8217;s prayer;
but were I to set all that is preserved of
it down here, it might be construed as a
mockery of that holy ordinance, than
which nothing is so far from my heart or
intention; but, convinced as I am that
a rude exhibition in such a divine solemnity
is of all things the most indecent and
unbecoming, I think such should be held
up to ridicule, as a warning to all Christians
never to ask ignorance or absurdity to perform
this sacred duty in public. The sublime
part of it therefore is given, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
meant as a fence against the spirit that had
set up his rest so near. To such as are not
acquainted with the pastoral terms, the
meaning in some parts may be equivocal;
to those who are, the train of thinking will
be obvious.&#8212;It is part of a genuine prayer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;But the last time we gathered oursels
before thee, we left out a wing o&#8217; the hirsel
by mistake, an&#8217; thou hast paid us hame i&#8217;
our ain coin. Thou wart sae gude than as
come to the sheddin thysel, an&#8217; clap our
heads, an&#8217; whisper i&#8217; our lugs, &#8216;dinna be
disheartened, my puir bits o&#8217; waefu&#8217; things,
for though ye be the shotts o&#8217; my hale fauld,
I&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; ye, an&#8217; herd ye, an&#8217; gie ye
a&#8217; that ye hae askit o&#8217; me the night.&#8217; It was
kind, an&#8217; thou hast done it; but we forgot
a principal part, an&#8217; maun tell thee now,
that we have had another visitor sin&#8217; ye
war here, an&#8217; ane wha&#8217;s back we wad rather
see than his face. Thou kens better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
thysel than we can tell thee what place he
has made his escape frae; but we sair dread
it is frae the boddomless pit, or he wadna
hae ta&#8217;en possession but leave. Ye ken,
that gang tried to keep vilent leasehaud o&#8217;
your ain fields, an&#8217; your ain ha&#8217;, till ye gae
them a killicoup. If he be ane o&#8217; them, O
come thysel to our help, an&#8217; bring in thy
hand a bolt o&#8217; divine vengeance, het i&#8217; the
furnace o&#8217; thy wrath as reed as a nailstring,
an&#8217; bizz him an&#8217; scouder him till ye dinna
leave him the likeness of a paper izel, until
he be glad to creep into the worm&#8211;holes o&#8217;
the earth, never to see sun or sterns mair.
But, if it be some puir dumfoundered soul
that has been bumbased and stoundit at
the view o&#8217; the lang Hopes an&#8217; the Downfa&#8217;s
o&#8217; Eternity, comed daundering away
frae about the laiggen girds o&#8217; Heaven to
the waefu&#8217; gang that he left behind, like a
lost sheep that strays frae the rich pastures
o&#8217; the south, an&#8217; comes bleating back a&#8217; the
gate to its cauld native hills, to the very
gair where it was lambed and first followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
its minny, ane canna help haeing a fellow&#8211;feeling
wi&#8217; the puir soul after a&#8217;, but
yet he&#8217;ll find himsel here like a cow in an
unco loan. Therefore, O furnish him this
night wi&#8217; the wings o&#8217; the wild gainner or
the eagle, that he may swoof away back to
a better hame than this, for we want nane
o&#8217; his company. An&#8217; do thou give to the
puir stray thing a weel&#8211;hained heff and a
beildy lair, that he may nae mair come
straggling amang a stock that&#8217;s sae unlike
himsel, that they&#8217;re frightit at the very look
o&#8217; him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast promised in thy Word to be
our shepherd, our guider an&#8217; director; an&#8217;
thy word&#8217;s as gude as some men&#8217;s aith, an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll haud thee at it. Therefore take thy

An&#8217; do thou, in thy good time an&#8217; way,
smear us ower the hale bouk wi&#8217; the tar o&#8217;

a&#8217; run out on the hips, an&#8217; as brown as a

an&#8217; every night, in within the true

the gelloch o&#8217; the ern; for if the arm of
our Shepherd be about us for good, a&#8217; the
imps, an&#8217; a&#8217; the powers o&#8217; darkness, canna
wrang a hair o&#8217; our tails.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>All the family arose from their knees
with altered looks. Thus fenced, a new
energy glowed in every breast. Poor Maysey,
proud of her husband&#8217;s bold and sublime
intercession, and trusting in the divine
fence now raised around them, rose
with the tear in her eye, seized the lamp,
and led the way, followed by all the rest,
to retake the apartment of Kirky&#8217;s ghost
by open assault. Nanny, whose faith wont
to be superior to all these things, lagged
behind, dreading to see the sight that she
had seen on the Saturday night before;
and the bold intercessor himself kept her
company, on pretence of a sleeping leg;
but, in truth, his faith in his own intercession
and fence did not mount very high.
All the apartment was searched&#8212;every
chest, corner, and hole that could be
thought of&#8212;every thing was quiet, and
not so much as a mouse stirring!&#8212;not a
bed&#8211;cover folded down, nor the smallest
remembered article missing! All the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
saw Kirky&#8217;s ghost enter in his own likeness,
and heard him speak in his wonted
tongue, except old Nanny. It was a great
and wonderful victory gained. They were
again in full possession of their own house,
a right which they never seemed before to
have duly appreciated. They felt grateful
and happy; and it was hinted by Maysey,
Dan, and uncle Nicholas, that Davie Tait
would turn out a burning and a shining
light in these dark and dismal times, and
would supersede Messrs Renwick, Shields,
and all the curates in the country. He had
laid a visible ghost, that might be the devil
for aught they knew to the contrary; and
it was argued on all hands, that &#8220;Davie
was nae sma&#8217; drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole of the simple group felt happy
and grateful; and they agreed to sit
another hour or two before they went to
sleep, and each one read a chapter from
the Bible, and recite a psalm or hymn.
They did so, until it came to Nanny&#8217;s turn.</p>

breast, turned in the balls of her half&#8211;closed

<p>This air, having a great resemblance to
the tone and manner in which the old Cameronians
said, or rather sung their prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and just no more music in it, as the singer
will perceive, than what renders the recitation
more slow and solemn, Nanny&#8217;s hymn
affected the family group in no ordinary
degree; it made the hairs of their head
creep, and thrilled their simple hearts, easily
impressed by divine things, while their
looks strongly expressed their feelings.
None of them would read or recite any
thing farther, but entreated Nanny to say
it over again, affirming, with one voice
that &#8220;it was an <i>extrodnar</i> thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! dear, dear bairns! I dinna ken
about it,&#8221; said she; &#8220;he was a good cannie
lad that made it, but he mixed wi&#8217; the
scoffers, and turned to hae his doubts and
his failings like mony ane, (Lord forgie us a&#8217;
for our share in them;) he seems even to
have doubted o&#8217; the Omnipresence when he
penned that, which was far far wrang. I&#8217;ll
rather say ye ane on that subject that he
had made when in a better way o&#8217; thinking.
It is said that the Englishes sing it in their
chapels.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>She then attempted one in a bolder and
more regular strain, but wanting the simplicity
of the former, it failed in having the
same effect. As it, however, closed the
transactions of that momentous night at
Riskinhope, we shall with it close this long
chapter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a> This curious protest is still extant, and shows the
true spirit of the old Covenanters or Cameronians, as
they have since been called, better than any work remaining.
It is called in the title page, &#8220;<i>An informatory
Vindication of a poor, wasted, misrepresented Remnant
of the suffering Anti&#8211;popish, Anti&#8211;prelatic, Anti&#8211;erastian,
Anti&#8211;sectarian, true Presbyterian Church of
Christ in Scotland</i>.&#8221; It is dated at Leadhills in 1687, and
is the conjoint work of Mr James Renwick, and Mr
Alexander Shiels, author of <i>The Hind let loose</i>. The
following is an extract from it, p. 107:&#8212;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And in like manner we do hereby disclaim all unwarrantable
practices committed by any few persons
reputed to be of us, whereby the Lord hath been offended,
his cause wronged, and we all made to endure
the scourge of tongues; for which things we have desired
to make conscience of mourning before the Lord,
both in public and private. As the unwarrantable manner
of killing that curate at the Corsephairn, though
he was a man of death both by the laws of God and
man, and the fact not materially murder; it being
gone about contrary to our declaration, common or
competent consent, (the conclusion and deed being
known only to three or four persons) in a rash and not
a Christian manner, and also other offences being committed
at the time; which miscarriages have proven a
mean to stop and retard lawful, laudable, and warrantable
proceeding, both as to matter and manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
These <i>other offences committed at the time</i>, unquestionably
refer to the slaughter of the Highland soldiers;
about which, there was great stir and numerous
conjectures in the country; although, owing to the revolution
that immediately followed, the perpetrators
were never taken, nor the cause tried in a court of justice,
nor indeed was the incident ever generally known.</p>
